# Changelog

All notable changes to the Jujutsu VCS Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Diffs of images (PNG, JPEG, etc.) and other binary files from a historical commit now open in IntelliJ's native image/binary diff viewer instead of showing the file's bytes decoded as garbled text — file content from jj is now kept as raw bytes until the IDE decides whether it's text or binary. File history's "open revision" views, which went through the same lossy text decoding, now get the exact bytes too.

## [0.8.18] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- The Working Copy panel's "Merge Conflicts" node now shows jj's own shape text per file (e.g. "2-sided conflict including 1 deletion") and gained two ways to resolve several files without going through an unspecified one-at-a-time queue: double-click a single conflicted row to open the merge tool for just that file, or multi-select several and use the new "Accept …" context-menu actions to resolve them all at once by side. Menu text is jj's own commit label when every selected file names the same commit (the common case for a single file, or several files from the same rebase/merge), or a generic "Side #1"/"Side #2" when they don't — never "Yours"/"Theirs", and never coercing unrelated conflicts under one label just because they share jj's wording. ([#66](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/66))
- Fixed a rare case where the conflicted-file editor banner's two "Accept <side>" links, and the new bulk accept actions above, could show the exact same label for both sides of a conflict (a `%%%%%%%` diff-style side whose header collided with the other side's, e.g. via a divergent commit) — jj's own text for the genuinely different side, previously discarded, is now used instead.
- Hovering any row in the bookmarks panel now shows a compact tooltip: a `[Local]`/`[<remote>]`/`[Tags]` group tag, the bookmark's full `/`-qualified path, a transitive count of bookmarks/tags for a folder, and — for a bookmark, tag, the "@" row, or an unbookmarked head — the change it points to (id, author, date, description, and a "@ Working Copy" tag when applicable), same as the log's own row tooltip. A local bookmark tracked by more than one remote shows each remote's own ahead/behind status, flagging when a push there would need to force-push. A repo line appears too in multi-repo projects. The log toolbar's tooltip toggle is renamed "Hover Tooltips" (from "Commit Tooltips") since it now gates both. ([#110](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/110))
- The bookmarks panel's "@" row and unbookmarked-head rows gained a "Navigate Log to Commit" action (right-click, and double-click on the "@" row) to jump straight to that change; unbookmarked-head rows also gained the same slashed-bookmark icon the log table uses for the same state.
- A commit's own hover tooltip (and the details panel) now shows "N commits ahead of &lt;bookmark&gt;" for a visible head with no bookmark on it, matching the bookmarks panel's own wording for the same state.

### Fixed
- The bookmarks panel and the log table's bookmark chips could show different, and sometimes meaningless, ahead/behind numbers for the same bookmark. A divergent (conflicted) local bookmark now gets an exact bidirectional count instead of jj's one-directional hint, and a local bookmark tracking a remote ref that doesn't exist on the remote (e.g. via `auto-track-created-bookmarks`) now shows no arrow and no number instead of a bogus distance-to-root count. ([#110](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/110))
- The bookmarks panel's "@" row and "Unbookmarked heads" rows no longer truncate a long bookmark name at the same fixed 30-character cap as the toolbar widget — they now show the full name, and in every case the trailing "+n" is never dropped by truncation. ([#107](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/107))
- In a colocated repo, the log table's bookmark chips no longer show a separate `@git` chip for each bookmark — it always mirrored the local jj bookmark and added no information, and the bookmarks panel already hid it the same way. ([#120](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/120))
- The log table no longer shows a blank, unlabeled header row above the columns. Columns can still be resized by dragging their border and reordered by dragging horizontally, directly in the rows (matching Git's own log view) — including the previously-unresizable last (Date) column. Also fixed Date coming out slightly too narrow under "Fit columns to window width". ([#78](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/78))

## [0.8.17] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Restore now opens a dialog listing every changed file, with your selection pre-checked but adjustable, instead of a plain Yes/No confirmation — applies to both "Restore" (working copy → parent revision) and "Restore to This" (working copy → a historical revision). A successful restore also now shows an undo balloon with an inline Undo link. ([#84](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/84))
- New "Move Up"/"Move Down" actions swap the selected commit with its single child or single parent in the commit graph (`jj rebase -A`/`-B`), as a keyboard-first complement to drag-and-drop reordering. Default shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down on every platform, including macOS - Cmd+Shift+Up/Down is deliberately not used there, since it's already the system shortcut for extending a selection to the top/bottom of a list; also in the log's right-click menu next to Rebase. Disabled when the selection isn't a single commit, doesn't have exactly one child/parent on that side, or the move would touch an immutable commit. ([#93](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/93))
- The conflicted-file editor banner now reflects jj's own incremental conflict model instead of a static "This file has merge conflicts": it shows a live count of remaining conflict blocks that updates as you hand-edit the markers (and disappears once the last one is gone, without waiting for a save), and offers "Accept <side>" links labelled with jj's own commit descriptions for each side, alongside the existing "Open Merge Tool" link. ([#112](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/112))
- Visible heads with no bookmark on them — work left behind after a forgotten `jj bookmark advance` — are now surfaced instead of silently sitting unnoticed: the bookmarks panel gets a collapsible "Unbookmarked heads" category (below the "@" row, above Local) listing each one as "\<closest bookmark\> +n \<change id\>", double-clickable to jump the log there, and the log table itself marks each such row with a small slashed-bookmark icon. ([#48](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/48), [#107](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/107))

### Changed
- The Working Copy tool window now has an icon representing a working copy rather than IntelliJ's default VCS icon ([#101](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/101))

### Fixed
- Restore, Show File History, Squash Selected Files, and Split no longer hide themselves for a deleted file selected alone in the Working Copy panel or a commit's changed-files list — a deleted file has no editor-visible content, and that was mistaken for "nothing selected". A selection mixing a deleted file with an edited one now restores both instead of silently dropping the deleted one. ([#122](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/122))
- The bookmark widget's/bookmarks panel's "\<name\> +N" indicator could show a wildly inflated (or capped, e.g. "+1000+") distance for a merge commit with one bookmarked parent and one unrelated, unbookmarked parent — it was counting the entire unrelated branch's history instead of the actual hops back to the bookmark.
- Scrolling the (early-access) paged log through a large repo's history got progressively slower the deeper you scrolled — each "Load more" page re-sorted and re-laid-out the entire log loaded so far, not just the new page, turning a scroll to depth N into roughly N² work. Loading a page now extends the previous merge/layout instead of recomputing it from scratch, so a long scroll costs roughly the same total work regardless of how many pages came before. ([#69](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/69))
- A divergent (conflicted) local bookmark couldn't be moved back onto the change it was already on — the natural way to resolve it — from either "Move Bookmark Here…" or "Move '\<bookmark\>' to Change…"; both dialogs assumed a bookmark has exactly one current target and excluded or misclassified it whenever a candidate matched. Every target is now offered, labelled "Resolve conflict", and selectable without ticking "Allow backward or sideways move". "Move '\<bookmark\>' to Change…" also now shows an undo balloon and supports Undo after a move, matching every other bookmark-move path. ([#121](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/121))
- A bookmark whose local ref was pending deletion (`jj bookmark delete`) but whose remote-tracking ref still existed could show a wildly wrong ahead count (e.g. "1000+ commits ahead") in the bookmarks panel — jj reports that count as the distance from the now-absent local ref to the repo root, not a real divergence. The log table already corrected this; the bookmarks panel, and every log-table refresh path past the very first load (paging, Refresh, search), now do too. ([#110](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/110))
- Toolbar Refresh now also re-reads bookmarks, tags, and working-copy state, not just log rows — previously an external change picked up only by the (unreliable on some network drives) op_heads file watch could leave the bookmark widget, bookmark chips, and reference filter stale even after clicking Refresh. ([#115](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/115))
- A conflicted file at a historical (non-working-copy) commit whose path contained a space was silently missing its conflict marker in that commit's changes list — the underlying `jj resolve --list` parser now reuses the same shape-aware parser as the working copy instead of a whitespace-splitting one, and populates the conflict registry for that revision too (laying groundwork for a future revision-aware conflicts view).
- Split's dialog now names the two resulting sides by what they *are* — "Existing commit"/"New commit" — consistently across the description labels, diff preview titles, summary line, and hunk picker, instead of a mix of DAG position ("Parent"/"Child"/"First"/"Second"/"Here") and a mismatched "(keeps change ID)" aside that only appeared on one of them; ticking a file now has the same meaning everywhere. The previous separate bold identity header and plain description sub-label above each description editor are combined into one label ("Description for existing commit (`<id>`)" / "Description for new commit (child of / sibling of / parent of `<id>`)"), dropping the redundant "(unchanged unless edited)" aside. A muted note under "Source" states the resulting shape, leading with the same "existing commit" naming, including that existing children become merges of both siblings in a parallel split, and word-wraps instead of forcing the dialog's left column wider. Every change id shown in these labels now uses the same bold-prefix/grey-remainder styling as the rest of the plugin. Toggling "Create parallel commits" also now relabels the description labels, note, and summary immediately, instead of only on the next file-tick. ([#101](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/101), [#114](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/114))

## [0.8.16] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Hovering a graph line whose other end (a distant ancestor/descendant, or a parent that hasn't loaded yet) is off-screen thickens the whole line and shows a directional cursor pointing toward it, plus a tooltip naming the target and how many rows up/down it is; if only one end is off-screen it always points there, and if both ends are off-screen which one it points to instead depends on which half of the visible log you're looking at. Clicking jumps there, loading it first if needed. A line hidden by the current filter shows the same tooltip but has no click action, since revealing it needs the filter cleared first.
- In a colocated repo, the bookmarks panel no longer shows a `git` remote group alongside your real remotes — it was jj's own view of the colocated repo's local Git refs, not a peer remote, and made every bookmark appear a third time. Remote groups also now start collapsed by default (Local and Tags are unaffected), with expand/collapse persisted per log window; a collapsed group with an ahead/behind or untracked bookmark inside shows a roll-up indicator so you don't lose visibility into what's unsynced. New Expand All/Collapse All buttons in the panel's toolbar. ([#48](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/48), [#111](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/111))
- Bookmark rows in the bookmarks panel now support the log's own change actions — New Change, New Change..., Edit Change, Rebase, and Duplicate — via right-click, including multi-select (Ctrl+Click several bookmark rows and "New Change From These" creates a merge with all of them as parents). Tag rows in the same panel gained the same actions. ([#48](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/48), [#108](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/108))
- Every bookmark row action (Delete/Forget/Rename/Advance/Push to all remotes/Track/Untrack, plus Filter Log to Bookmark and Navigate Log to Bookmark) is now registered and keymap-assignable in Settings → Keymap, shows a shortcut hint in the bookmarks panel's own right-click menu once bound, and double-clicking a bookmark row navigates to its change the same way double-clicking a log row shows its diff. ([#48](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/48), [#109](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/109))
- A local bookmark ahead of or behind its tracked remote now shows the same `↑n`/`↓m` divergence indicator on its own leaf in the bookmarks panel that a remote bookmark already showed — previously it always read 0/0 regardless of the actual state. With more than one tracked remote, the indicator shows the largest divergence rather than summing across remotes; per-remote detail is a follow-up. ([#48](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/48), [#110](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/110))
- "Open Jujutsu Log" is now reachable from VCS → Jujutsu and from the VCS Operations popup, instead of only via Find Action or a manually-bound shortcut; invoking it while the log tab is already open but the tool window is hidden now brings it to the front instead of appearing to do nothing. ([#118](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/118))

### Fixed
- Splitting a change with zero whole files ticked but one or more files partially picked via "Pick Hunks…" was rejected with "Move at least one file to the child" — hunks-only splits (nothing fully ticked) now work as expected. ([#117](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/117))
- The bookmarks panel always showed remote bookmarks with the "tracked" icon and never showed ahead/behind divergence, regardless of the actual state — an untracked remote bookmark's context menu also always offered "Untrack" instead of "Track". ([#48](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/48), [#110](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/110))
- A conflicted or divergent local bookmark (e.g. moved to different targets by two concurrent operations) vanished from the bookmarks panel entirely, even though the log table still showed it with its conflict marker — the same defect affected conflicted tags. ([#110](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/110))
- A stale jj workspace (`jj workspace update-stale`) no longer breaks the Working Copy tool window, or shows a wrong/missing message instead of the right one — this now covers essentially every command and dialog, not just the Working Copy panel: Advance/Rename/Create/Move Bookmark, Set Tag, Push, Show History, and the Split/Squash/Rebase/New Change dialogs' commit pickers. All now offer a one-click "Update Stale Workspace" action that repairs it and automatically finishes whatever you were doing. (Annotate still reports the error as before — a fix attempt there didn't pan out.)
- Renaming or creating a bookmark could show a flatly wrong "There is already a bookmark with that name" error for any failure at all (e.g. an invalid target revision) — it now only shows that message when jj actually reports a name conflict.
- The Move Bookmark dialog could warn that a move was "backward or sideways" even when it was genuinely forward, if the classification query failed for any reason (including a stale workspace) — it now surfaces the failure instead of silently guessing backward.
- A large changes tree with a Jujutsu repository root visible could freeze the UI for tens of seconds — the repo-root icon lookup was doing a blocking VCS-root resolution from inside the tree's paint path on every repaint.
- A commit whose parent has been filtered out of view now shows a wiggly line down from its circle instead of no connector at all — which looked identical to a true repository root.
- A commit whose parent falls beyond the configured log limit now shows a faded straight line down from its circle instead of no connector at all — which looked identical to a true repository root. A commit whose parent has been filtered out of view instead shows a wiggly line, since that's genuine elision (like jj's own `~`) rather than history that simply hasn't loaded yet — the two previously looked the same. A merge with one loaded parent and one unresolved parent now shows its stub too, in its own lane alongside the real connector.
- Settings → Keymap showed the raw action id instead of a real name for the main-toolbar bookmark widget (`Jujutsu.MainToolbarBookmarks`) and "Undo Last Jujutsu Operation" (`Jujutsu.UndoLastOperation`).
- Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu's "Installation Help" no longer goes stale while Settings stays open: clicking Test now previews its wording, gated-feature list, and command rows against the path you just tested — even before clicking Apply — instead of only updating after reopening Settings. A fully up-to-date jj also now shows neutral "how to update later" wording and update commands, instead of "if jj is not installed, use...".
- Installation Help's Cargo upgrade command now passes `--force`, instead of being identical to the install command — without it, `cargo install` refuses to overwrite an already-installed `jj` binary, so the shown command would have failed instead of upgrading.
- Every mutating command (New Change, Edit, Abandon, Rebase, Squash, Split, Duplicate Onto, Restore, Undo, resolving a merge conflict, switching working copies) could briefly freeze the UI on a large repository, tripping IntelliJ's "slow operation may freeze UI" assertion — the post-command VFS refresh's recursive directory walk ran synchronously on the EDT despite requesting an async refresh; it now runs on a background thread. ([#113](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/113))
- On IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1, running any jj command could crash with "Access is allowed from write thread only" — the pre-command document-save check queried whether writing was allowed before acquiring the write-intent lock that check itself required on that platform version.
- Resolving a rebase conflict could show your own change as "Theirs" and the commit you rebased onto as "Yours" — which side jj renders as full content vs. a diff varies per conflict, not per operation, so a fixed guess was right about half the time. The merge tool now reads jj's own per-side label from the conflict markers and names the panes after the actual commits (falling back to "Side #1"/"Side #2" when markers carry no commit info), and orients "Yours" to your own change; merge and squash conflicts are unaffected. ([#112](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/112))
- Double-clicking a conflicted file's diff for any commit other than the working copy showed "Cannot show diff: Could not extract conflict data" (or, worse, silently showed the working copy's unrelated conflict) — the diff always read the file from disk regardless of which commit's diff was opened. It now reads that commit's own conflicted content, so browsing the log to a conflicted commit shows its own three-way conflict, whether it's an ancestor of the working copy, a descendant that inherited the conflict, or an unrelated commit. ([#119](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/119))
- The log graph got measurably slower to repaint and to hover the further down a long log you scrolled — drawing a row's connector lines rescanned every row above it, and hovering a long edge rebuilt its whole lane index on every mouse move and scroll tick instead of reusing the cache already built for it. Both now do constant work per row/event regardless of scroll position or log size.

## [0.8.15] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- A new "Set Diff Base" quick action (VCS main menu → Jujutsu, and Jujutsu → Set Diff Base in the editor's right-click menu) for switching what editor gutter markers and Annotate compare against, without a trip to Settings — pick "Working copy parent", "Latest immutable ancestor (trunk)", "Previous commit (grandparent)", type a custom revset expression, or pin to any specific revision via a search popup. It writes the same setting as the Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → Diff Base row, so the two never disagree. ([#43](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/43))
- "Undo..." and "Set Diff Base" are now grouped under a "Jujutsu" submenu in the VCS main menu, in the same section as the "Git" submenu, instead of sitting as separate top-level items — "Initialise Jujutsu Repository" stays where it already was, alongside Git/Mercurial/Subversion's own "init" actions.
- The Diff Base setting (Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu, and the new quick action above) gained a fourth option, "Previous commit (grandparent)" — the commit before your last one, or trunk if you're right above it. ([#43](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/43))
- Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu's "Installation Help" now tells you when your jj is too old for a plugin feature (e.g. Advance Bookmark, which needs jj 0.39+), listing exactly which one(s) and switching straight to the matching upgrade command — no separate section to find, and it stays out of your way entirely when your jj already supports everything.
- The log's Root filter can now exclude a repository, not just include one: click a root once to show only it, click again to hide just that one and show everything else, click a third time to clear it. A new "Select All"/"Select None" option at the top of the filter bulk-selects every root. Handy when you have many repositories open and only want to mute a couple of noisy ones rather than picking every other repo by hand. ([#96](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/96))

### Fixed
- The Describe dialog's prompt now shows the short change id (matching the id shown everywhere else in the UI) instead of the full 64-character id. ([#76](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/76))
- Split's per-file preview no longer shows the same content on both sides for a fully-ticked file: the right-hand "Child" pane now actually shows the child's content, matching its title, instead of duplicating the parent side and appearing to show no changes at all. ([#101](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/101))
- Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu no longer shows a horizontal scrollbar in a multi-repo project with a per-repository diff-base override set.
- The Installation Help section's command labels ("Homebrew:", "Cargo:", etc.) now have a comfortable gap before their command box instead of sitting flush against it, and several rows across the page take up less minimum width, reducing the chance of a horizontal scrollbar in a narrower Settings window.
- The status bar working-copy widget no longer grows to fill the whole status bar and crowd out other widgets when the current change has a very long description — it now ellipsizes to a sensible width, shrinking further on a narrow window, with the full description still available in its tooltip. ([#95](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/95))
- The status bar working-copy widget and the bookmark widget's status-bar fallback now match the padding, text colour, and hover/pressed highlight of every other status bar widget, instead of using their own slightly-off colours — including a case where the highlight could get stuck on permanently after the first hover. ([#95](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/95))
- The Working Copy tool window sometimes started up with an empty description box and every toolbar button greyed out, recovering only after the next change to the working copy. Also, disabling the description box (e.g. while no repository is selected) now actually makes it read-only, instead of silently accepting typing that went nowhere.
- The bookmark toolbar widget and both status bar widgets no longer show up in projects that aren't Jujutsu repositories — they used to appear (as an empty, non-functional widget) in any project as soon as the plugin was installed. They now also appear immediately after running Jujutsu → Init, without needing to restart the IDE. ([#100](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/100))
- Fetching from a remote could log a "Write-unsafe context!" IDE error and, more importantly, silently skip saving your edited files before the jj command ran, so it could operate on stale on-disk content — a regression from an earlier fix for a shutdown hang. Saving is now legal again in all cases, and a modal dialog still can't block indefinitely while it waits. ([#106](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/106))
- "Move Bookmark Here..." and "Move Bookmark to Change..." no longer open with OK greyed out when a valid destination is already selected — the OK button now reflects the pre-selected row immediately, instead of only updating after you change the selection or tick "Allow backwards or sideways move". ([#105](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/105))
- Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu now shows the identity actually in effect for each repository — including one set by a jj config scope (e.g. `--when.repositories`) — and no longer prompts to configure an identity a scope already supplies. The global "User Identity" fields now read and write the same (user-level) scope, instead of showing a merged value they couldn't actually update. ([#89](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/89))
- The log's right-click menu, the bookmark widget dropdown, and the bookmarks panel's `@` node now say "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" instead of "Advance Bookmark Here" — in a per-row menu, "Here" read as "move the bookmark to this row," but the action always advances the nearest bookmark to your current working copy, never to the clicked row. ([#104](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/104))

## [0.8.14] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- Editor gutter change markers and Annotate (blame) can now be based on the latest immutable ancestor (trunk) or any revset you choose, instead of always the working copy's parent — useful when you have several commits stacked on top of trunk and want to see everything changed so far, not just the last one. Configure it in Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → Diff Base, project-wide or per repository; the Local Changes / Working copy view is unaffected. ([#43](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/43))
- A dedicated bookmarks panel to the left of the log table, expanded by default: a tree of every repo's bookmarks and tags, colour-matched to their log-table chips, with `feature/A`/`feature/B`-style names shown as a hierarchy instead of a flat list, matching the Git plugin's Branches panel. Its "@" node carries the same working-copy marker and colour as the log, and an issue-tracker reference embedded in a bookmark or tag name (e.g. `JIRA-123-fix-thing`) is a clickable link, same as everywhere else in the plugin. Collapse/expand it via the always-visible strip at the panel's edge or the toolbar's View Options popup. Right-click a bookmark for the same actions as its dropdown menu, plus "Filter Log to Bookmark" and "Navigate Log to Bookmark". ([#48](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/48))
- The log's right-click menu gained "Compare with Another Commit..." and "Compare Before with Another Commit...", letting you diff a whole commit (or its parent) against any bookmark, change ID, or revision you pick, not just the working copy.
- Every description field in the plugin — Describe, Split, Squash Into, New Change, and the Working Copy tool window — is now a real commit-message editor instead of a plain text box: spellcheck, subject-length/format highlighting, and a recent-messages history popup (Ctrl+E / Cmd+E), shared with the IDE's own Git commit UI. IdeaVim users get proper Insert-mode support (Escape no longer closes the dialog). ([#46](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/46))
- The Working Copy tool window's file list, and the log's commit details pane when showing the working copy, now work with the IDE's own file actions — Reformat Code and Optimize Imports act on the files you've selected there, the same as in the built-in Commit view. Right-clicking a file there also gained the standard Annotate action. ([#94](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/pull/94))
- A one-time, dismissible notification now tells you when upgrading your `jj` executable would unlock additional plugin features (starting with Advance Bookmark, which needs jj 0.39+), with a link straight to the settings page to update the executable path.
- Abandoning a change now shows an "Undo" link right in the confirmation notification. If you dismiss it, the VCS menu keeps a persistent "Undo Abandon" entry so you can still undo it later — it only ever undoes the specific abandon you just did, never anything a background process or another window did in the meantime.

### Changed
- The commit pickers in Rebase, Squash Into…, Duplicate Onto…, and Move Bookmark to Change now use the same search as the log window: regex, match-case, and whole-words toggles, and bookmark-name matching. Pressing Enter with no match in the currently-loaded list runs a one-off search of the whole repository (the same fallback the log window's search already has), so you can now rebase onto, squash into, duplicate onto, or move a bookmark to a commit that isn't in the loaded window — for example by pasting its full change ID or Git hash.

### Fixed
- Hovering a commit row's tooltip in the Rebase, Squash Into…, Duplicate Onto…, and New Change dialogs no longer shows a broken-image icon in place of bookmark/tag chips.

## [0.8.13] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Issue-tracker references (e.g. `JIRA-123`) in the "Working copy" tool window's current-change summary — including inside a bookmark name — now render as clickable links, matching the log table and commit details pane. ([#15](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/15))
- A "Push" action on a bookmark's own context menu (right-click its chip in the log, or its sub-menu in the bookmark widget) opens the Push dialog pre-selected to that bookmark and remote, skipping the repo/remote/bookmark selection steps a fresh dialog needs — a single OK click pushes it. With more than one Git remote it becomes a submenu, one entry per remote, each disabled with "(up to date)" shown when that particular remote already has the bookmark's current position. ([#81](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/81))
- With more than one Git remote, a bookmark's Push submenu also gains a "Push to all remotes" entry that pushes it everywhere it's ahead in one click, still showing the usual force-push/deletion confirmations per remote.
- The Push dialog gained a fourth scope, "Create bookmark for change", which auto-generates a remote bookmark for a specific commit instead of requiring one to be created by hand first — matching jj's own recommended `jj git push --change` workflow. Selecting one or more commits in the log before opening Push (from either the log's right-click menu or the toolbar/VCS-menu button) targets this scope at exactly those commits, pushing one bookmark per selected change in a single confirmation when more than one is selected. A new "Default push scope" setting lets you make it (or any other scope) the dialog's default. ([#65](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/65))
- The "Squash Into..." dialogs now show a read-only diff preview for the selected file, matching Split's preview: a "Before" pane and a "Destination" pane, updating as you click files or tick/untick them.
- The "Squash Into..." dialogs gained a "Pick Hunks…" button, letting you squash only part of a file's change into the destination while the rest stays in the source — the same three-pane arrow picker Split already uses. Only available when squashing a single source; the file shows half-checked afterward, and unchecking/rechecking discards the partial pick.
- "New Change..." in the log's right-click menu now opens a dialog offering a description, a placement choice (a plain child — jj's default — or inserting the new change before/after the selected commit(s), rebasing the affected descendants onto it), and whether the working copy follows, with a live preview of the resulting graph before you commit to it. ([#83](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/83))

### Changed
- Bookmark rename dialog name field is now initially set to the old bookmark name. ([#82]((https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/82)))
- Split's "Pick Hunks…" now opens a three-pane diff — the original content, a live preview of what the parent will look like, and the child's content — with a click-to-move arrow at each divider, instead of a merge-conflict-style tool. This also removes an unrelated "mark the conflict resolved anyway?" confirmation that previously appeared every time you applied a partial pick.

### Fixed
- A bookmark deleted locally but still pending deletion on the remote (shown with strikethrough in the log) is no longer silently missing from the Push dialog's "Specific bookmark" dropdown when the dialog is opened from a commit's right-click menu — it previously appeared only from the toolbar's Push button.
- The Push dialog's "Specific bookmark" dropdown no longer lists a tracked bookmark twice, once normally and once mislabelled "(new)".
- The IDE no longer reports an internal error when a Jujutsu repository can't be read (e.g. a broken or moved `.jj` store). Instead: a warning notification appears with **Retry** and **Configure VCS Mappings...** actions, the Working copy tool window's empty state explains that the repository couldn't be read rather than claiming none are configured, the broken mapping shows in red under Settings → Version Control → Directory Mappings, and the plugin automatically detects when the repository is repaired and recovers without any manual action.
- The log no longer reports an error when a selected change has been abandoned or rewritten outside the IDE — the selection is simply dropped instead of repeatedly failing on every refresh. ([#76](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/76))
- Updating the plugin without restarting the IDE no longer leaves a stale log window on screen, which could throw internal errors from its Fetch/Push toolbar buttons until the IDE was restarted. ([#73](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/73), [#86](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/86))
- The file history table (right-click a file → "Show History") no longer shows blank Date, Author, and Committer columns. ([#88](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/88))
- Sorting the file history table by its "Commit Time" column now orders rows by date instead of alphabetically by committer name.
- Closing a project while the log is still loading no longer risks a multi-minute stall; the load is now cancelled promptly instead of waiting out a fixed timeout.
- Removed a blocking `jj` call that could occasionally freeze "Open in Remote" and the bookmark Push submenu when opened for the first time in a session.
- The Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu page no longer needs horizontal scrolling to reach its right-hand controls; fields shrink to fit and grow with the window, and long error messages now wrap instead of widening the page. The revset expression field is now a multi-line box that word-wraps long expressions and lines up with the fields above it.
- The commit details panel no longer shows a stale diff after selecting a different commit that touches the same file(s) as the previously selected one — the tab title updated but the diff content kept showing the old selection's changes.

## [0.8.12] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- Rebase and Describe are now available as one-click buttons on the log toolbar, alongside New and Edit, with default keyboard shortcuts — previously only reachable via the right-click menu. Their right-click menu entries now show the same shortcut. Edit also gained a default keyboard shortcut of its own. ([#78](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/78))
- New "Split into New Parent…" action alongside the existing "Split into New Child…" in file right-click menus, for splitting selected files off into a new commit that precedes the current one instead of one that follows it — useful for peeling off small commits backwards from a large verified set of changes. The current commit keeps its own change ID (and the working copy, if you're splitting it, stays put); only the new, split-off commit gets a new ID. The dialog is explicit about which side is which and, when splitting the working copy, about where `@` ends up either way. ([#74](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/74))
- "Show History" is now available from file right-click menus in the commit details panel, the Working Copy tool window, and compare-changes panels, matching the editor's Jujutsu submenu.
- Pressing Enter in the log search field now searches the whole repository, not just the commits currently loaded in the log window — useful for pasting a Git hash or finding an older commit by description or author. Matching commits are added into the log, and the status bar reports how many (or that none) were found.

### Changed
- The log search field now matches anywhere in a commit's full description, not just its first line.

### Fixed
- Fixed right-clicking a change-id link (e.g. a parent reference in a merge commit's details) showing an empty "Nothing Here" menu instead of that commit's usual context menu.
- Fixed 0.8.11 failing JetBrains Marketplace's compatibility check and never going out to users — the Working Copy toolbar's Rebase/Squash/Abandon/etc. buttons and the status-bar bookmark widget used a couple of platform APIs the Marketplace flags but our own build didn't catch.

## [0.8.11] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- The Working Copy tool window's toolbar now offers the common actions for the current change — Split, Squash into Parent, Abandon, Create Bookmark Here, Advance Bookmark Here, and Set Tag Here — alongside New Change, so you don't have to switch to the log to act on `@`. In a multi-root project, the repository selector now sits in that same row instead of further down the panel, and the changes tree collapses every other repository's changes into a single, per-repository-grouped "Other Repositories" group (and shows a "(no changes)" line for the selected repository when it's clean) so it's clear which repository the toolbar and description above are acting on. Advancing a bookmark from this toolbar now confirms with a Yes/No prompt before moving it, names the bookmark in its tooltip, and confirms with a notification once it moves, since — unlike the other actions here — it otherwise has no dialog and no other visible effect. ([#61](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/61))
- The bookmark indicator has moved out of the Jujutsu log window and into the main IDE toolbar, next to where Git's branch widget sits — so you can see which bookmark you're on, and act on it, without opening the log. If the main toolbar is hidden (Classic UI, or New UI with "Show main toolbar" turned off), the same indicator now appears in the status bar instead. ([#62](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/62))
- The log and file-history toolbars' eye-icon menu (now called "View Options") has two new tick-boxes: "Commit Tooltips", to turn off the row hover tooltip for anyone who finds it more distracting than useful now that the details pane covers the same info on selection ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51), [#75](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/75)); and "Alternating Row Colors", to turn off the striped row background, where available in the current theme ([#79](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/79)). The column-visibility and details-position toggles that used to live in two separate submenus now live alongside them in one flat menu.
- Two new settings under Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu:
  - A setting for how many surrounding revisions to load when jumping to a commit outside the visible log (e.g. from file annotation) — including an option to load only the target revision, with no surrounding context. Overridable per repository. ([#80](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/80))
  - A global "disable ignored-file scanning" option that applies to every repository, instead of having to turn it off one repository at a time — individual repositories can still opt back in. ([#35](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/35))

### Changed
- Freed up space in the log window's toolbar now that the bookmark widget has moved (see above), so more of the filter row stays visible before collapsing into the "»" overflow.

### Fixed
- Fixed the log occasionally failing to load with an "ambiguous change ID prefix" error when jumping to a commit outside the loaded window (e.g. from file annotation, or navigating to a bookmark), or when squashing a change — a shortened change ID cached from an earlier moment could stop being unique by the time it was reused. ([#76](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/76))
- Fixed diffs, file history, restore, split, squash, and conflict resolution failing on files whose path contains parentheses or square brackets (e.g. Next.js app-router routes like `app/(app)/users/[id]/page.tsx`) — the diff pane used to show "Cannot get content from this revision." ([#73](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/73))
- Fixed the bookmark widget in the log toolbar showing no bookmark at all (just the empty "Bookmark:" label) most of the time, instead of the nearest-bookmark indicator added in 0.8.9 — it now shows correctly from the moment the log opens, and keeps up to date after commands run outside the IDE (e.g. `jj new` in a terminal).
- Fixed change descriptions in the log window's details pane and tooltips rendering with non-breaking spaces instead of the regular spaces you typed — this broke word-wrapping on long descriptions and, worse, meant copying description text pasted invisible non-breaking spaces in place of normal ones. ([#77](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/77))

## [0.8.10] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that could have crashed "Init" (create a new Jujutsu repository) on IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 and 2025.2.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- New "Advance Bookmark Here" action moves the bookmark nearest the working copy forward to it in one click (`jj bookmark advance`), instead of requiring a manual "Move Bookmark Here…"; if more than one bookmark is equally close, you're prompted to choose which to move. Available from the bookmark widget in the log toolbar and from the log's right-click menu. Also added a per-bookmark "Advance … to Working Copy" action alongside each bookmark's existing Rename/Delete/Forget actions. Requires jj 0.39 or later — on an older jj, these actions are shown disabled, with the reason (e.g. "needs jj 0.39+") shown right in the menu item's text as well as its tooltip, and a link to upgrade in Settings. ([#61](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/61))
- The bookmark widget in the log toolbar no longer goes blank once you move past every bookmark (e.g. after `jj new`) — it now shows the nearest bookmark behind the working copy and how many changes behind it is, e.g. `main +3`. ([#62](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/62))
- The "+N more" indicator for collapsed bookmark/tag labels in the log now shows a coloured bookmark (or tag) icon instead of plain grey text, so a change with many bookmarks is still recognisable as a branch head even when its labels overflow; it shows the tracked-bookmark icon when every hidden bookmark is tracked, and the same hover background highlight as a bookmark/tag chip. Clicking it now also shows the correct tracked/untracked/tag icon next to each hidden bookmark or tag in the popup, and fixes all its menu items showing as disabled when there were many hidden bookmarks. ([#49](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/49))
- New "Compare Before with Another Commit…" action in the Jujutsu file menus, comparing a file's parent version against any bookmark, change ID, or revision you pick.

### Fixed
- "Annotate" is now available when a file is opened from a historical commit (e.g. from the log or File History) — it used to be greyed out.
- The diff viewer's right-click menu no longer shows "Annotate" twice (once at top level, once under "Jujutsu").
- Fixed a rare UI freeze risk: "Annotate Previous Revision" could block the UI thread while checking whether a line's parent revision still has the file.
- In a multi-root project, filtering the log to a bookmark or tag no longer pulls in unrelated commits from your *other* repositories, and the graph no longer draws a connecting line between different repositories' commits. Filtering to "@" (working copy) now also shows every repository's working copy, not just the first one's.
- "Annotate Previous Revision" no longer shows a raw error when clicked on a line whose change added the file (so there's no earlier version to show) — the action is simply unavailable for that line instead, matching how it already behaves for merge-commit lines.
- On repositories where computing blame is slow, the editor no longer eagerly re-computes it for every file you open — it now backs off automatically once blame has been consistently slow, and only computes it on demand when you actually open the annotation gutter. Cached blame is also now refreshed whenever the working copy changes, instead of potentially showing stale attribution. ([#64](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/64))
- Fixed a build issue that could have prevented the plugin from being verified as compatible with IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1.
- Viewing a file's diff no longer jumps back to the top whenever a background process (e.g. an AI coding assistant) edits a file elsewhere in the repository. Viewing the working copy's own diff also now shows live content instead of a stale snapshot if the file changes while its diff is open. ([#58](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/58))
- Improved plugin compatibility by removing dependency on IntelliJ internal action API.
- Bookmark, tag, working-copy (`@`), conflict and divergent-change colours in the log and annotation gutter are now readable on a light theme background — the bookmark gold in particular was nearly invisible. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- Fixed a memory leak that kept every project you'd opened pinned in memory for the rest of the IDE session, once its repository icon had been drawn anywhere (e.g. a multi-root VCS changes tree or the bookmark widget).
- After clicking "Initialize" on the uninitialized-repository notification (or via VCS → Jujutsu → Initialize), the Working Copy tool window now shows the repository's changes and file statuses/editor colours update immediately, instead of staying empty/stale until some unrelated later action.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-08-07

### Changed
- Conflicted files in the "Working copy" tool window are now grouped under a "Merge Conflicts" node at the top of the tree with a one-click "Resolve" link, and the toolbar gained a "Resolve All Conflicts" button — matching the grouped resolve affordance the standard Commit tool window used to provide, before it was hidden. ([#56](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/56))
- Opening a conflicted file now shows a banner at the top of the editor with a one-click "Resolve" link, so you don't need to already know about the Jujutsu submenu to find conflict resolution. ([#56](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/56))
- Issue-tracker references (e.g. `JIRA-123`) in a commit's description now render as clickable links in the log table itself, not just the commit details pane — link-colored, underlining only the exact reference while hovered, with the same left-click-to-open/right-click "Open" menu as elsewhere. Requires an Issue Navigation pattern configured under Settings → Version Control. ([#15](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/15))
- Issue-tracker references (e.g. `JIRA-123`) *inside* a bookmark or tag name (e.g. a bookmark named `jira-123-fix-thing`) are now their own clickable link within the chip, separate from the chip's own right-click menu — link-colored, hand cursor and underline only on that exact reference, opening the same as elsewhere on left-click, in both the log table and the commit details pane. ([#15](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/15))
- The log's hover tooltip now stays open when you move the pointer into it, so you can click its links or select and copy its text, and it now disappears as soon as you scroll instead of lingering over the view. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- Bookmark and tag creation, bookmark deletion, and bookmark forgetting now show distinctive icons instead of generic ones. A bookmark pending deletion shows a dashed outline in the log instead of just strikethrough text, and a conflicted bookmark shows a distinct red icon instead of a generic warning triangle.

### Fixed
- Annotating (blaming) a file that contains a null byte anywhere in its content no longer fails with an error; a null byte in a Kotlin source file was previously enough to break annotation for that entire file.
- Resolving a conflict where one side deleted the file (a "modify/delete" conflict) by accepting the deleted side now actually removes the file, instead of leaving behind an empty file. Failures while resolving a conflict now show an error notification instead of failing silently.
- Annotating (blaming) a file in a very large repository no longer fails with a blank error message. Annotation now gets a longer time limit before giving up, and if it does still run out of time you'll see a clear message explaining why instead of an empty one. ([#64](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/64))
- Saving a file no longer switches the editor to the diff preview tab (opened by double-clicking a file in the Working Copy panel or commit details pane). ([#67](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/67))
- Fixed the Push button sometimes doing nothing: switching the remote (or, in a multi-repository project, the repository) in the push dialog before clicking Push could silently reset your bookmark selection and leave the button unresponsive. Also, pushing a bookmark that was already up to date no longer shows a generic "Push complete" message — it now shows jj's own "Nothing changed" notice.
- In a repository containing any divergent change, "Move Bookmark Here…" and "Move '\<bookmark\>' to Change…" showed every destination as a backward/sideways move, requiring you to tick "Allow backward or sideways move" even for a genuine forward move onto a descendant.
- Fixed a potential crash showing repository icons for folders in VCS dialogs (e.g. the Commit tool window) on IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-08-02

### Changed
- Issue-tracker references (e.g. `JIRA-123`) in a commit's description now render as clickable links in the log table itself, not just the commit details pane — link-colored, underlining only the exact reference while hovered, with the same left-click-to-open/right-click "Open" menu as elsewhere. Requires an Issue Navigation pattern configured under Settings → Version Control. ([#15](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/15))
- In a jj-only project, the standard IDE "Commit" tool window and its "Local Changes" tab are now hidden — they only ever showed a half-working commit dialog and a look-alike changes list that lacked jj's actions, which confused people into using it instead of the "Working copy" tool window. This also removes the "Resolve" link on the Commit tool window's conflict node, which never worked for jj conflicts. A new "Hide the standard Commit tool window" setting (Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu) lets you turn it back on; projects that also use Git alongside jj are unaffected either way. ([#56](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/56))
- The "Working copy" tool window now opens automatically (without stealing focus) the first time you open a jj project, and a one-time tip explains what it's for and how it replaces the standard Commit panel. ([#56](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/56))
- Conflicted files in the "Working copy" tool window are now grouped under a "Merge Conflicts" node at the top of the tree with a one-click "Resolve" link, and the toolbar gained a "Resolve All Conflicts" button — matching the grouped resolve affordance the standard Commit tool window used to provide, before it was hidden. ([#56](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/56))
- "Compare with Working Copy" and "Show Diff in New Tab" (for multiple files) now open a Changes pane listing every differing file, with the current one highlighted, instead of a bare diff with only a file-selector dropdown. Selecting a file in the list updates the diff in place. ([#52](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/52))
- Author/committer names in the log and commit details pane are now real hyperlinks, link-colored at rest and underlining only while hovered: click a name to email them, right-click for more options including filtering by author, with a checkmark on whichever author filter is currently active (clicking the same one again toggles it off). ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- Bookmark/tag chips in the log and commit details pane are right-click only — filter the log to that reference, rename/delete/etc., with a checkmark on whichever reference filter is active. Hovering one shows a subtle grey background highlight instead of a hand cursor, since there's no left-click action to imply — a prerequisite for a future release that turns issue-tracker references *inside* a bookmark/tag name into their own links, which would otherwise be confusing nested inside a whole-chip hyperlink.
- "Resolve Conflicts…" now opens conflicted files one at a time in the three-way merge tool instead of a single dialog listing all of them together, as part of the fix below.
- The log's References filter dropdown now shows a disabled "Loading bookmarks and tags…" placeholder instead of looking empty right after opening the project/log, while bookmarks and tags are still loading in the background.

### Fixed
- Closing the conflict resolution window without resolving (or after resolving only some conflicts) no longer discards a side of the conflict, for every "Resolve Conflicts…" entry point jj-idea provides (Working Copy panel, commit details pane, log context menu, editor/Project view). Each conflicted file is now resolved through its own merge window; cancelling leaves the file's conflict untouched. ([#63](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/63)) **Known gap:** the native IntelliJ Commit tool window's own "Resolve" link (on the "Merge Conflicts" node) is separate platform UI that jj-idea cannot intercept, and is still affected — see docs/manual-tests.md for details; avoid it for jj conflicts for now.
- "Resolve Conflicts…" no longer appears on a non-conflicted file just because some other, unrelated file in the repository has a conflict.
- Hovering a bookmark or tag in the "Switch Working Copy" popup (opened from the status bar widget) no longer shows a broken-image icon in the tooltip.
- Bookmark/tag chip icons in tooltips (and the commit details pane) are now vertically aligned with the surrounding text instead of floating above it.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- The Push dialog no longer crashes with an error when opened. The Fetch dialog had the same problem for repositories with more than one remote. ([#60](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/60))

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-27

### Changed
- Rebase and duplicate now use jj's `--onto` flag instead of the deprecated `-d`/`--destination`, ahead of its removal in a future jj release.

### Fixed
- Fixed a crash risk on IntelliJ/RustRover 2025.1 and 2025.2 (builds 251/252) when initialising a repo or when VCS roots changed.
- The "Resolve Conflicts…" action now opens the merge dialog on IntelliJ/RustRover 2026.2 (build 262) instead of silently doing nothing. ([#55](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/55))
- The Split dialog's file checkboxes now work the way you'd expect: ticking a file moves it into the new child commit (unticked files stay in the parent), nothing is ticked by default, and the child's description field is shown above the parent's, matching their order in the log. Right-clicking file(s) and choosing "Split into New Child" now starts those files ticked, so they land in the new child commit instead of the parent. ([#54](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/54))
- "Pick Hunks…" now has a fixed, always-reversible layout: a "Before" reference on one side and the child's content on the other, with an editable "Parent" in the middle you can pull hunks into or out of from either side, as many times as you like, instead of a one-way pick with no way to change your mind. Picking only some of a file's hunks no longer forces the whole file to look fully assigned to the child. Reopening "Pick Hunks…" on a file you already partially split now resumes where you left off instead of resetting.
- Splitting with individual hunks picked (via "Pick Hunks…") no longer fails with "Failed to edit diff" / `NoClassDefFoundError: kotlin/jvm/internal/Intrinsics` on some IDE installs.
- "Annotate Previous Revision" now re-annotates at the correct parent commit instead of an arbitrary one. On a line introduced by a merge commit, where there's no single correct "previous" revision, the action is unavailable rather than guessing wrong.
- Annotating a file whose working copy (or an ancestor) is a merge commit no longer fails with "Revset `@-` resolved to more than one revision".
- Annotating a resolved merge conflict no longer shows a spurious "number of lines annotated is not equal to number of lines in the file" warning. Blame now correctly attributes each line to whichever original commit introduced it, with conflict-resolution lines attributed to the merge itself.
- Annotating a merge no longer fails with "No such path" when the file exists in only some of the merge's parents (e.g. a criss-cross merge where a file was added on only one side). Blame is now assembled from whichever parents actually have the file.
- Pressing Enter in the Working Copy tool window's description box inserts a newline again. On 2026.2, it instead opened the current commit's diff — the log's "Enter shows diff" shortcut was firing even while typing in the description field, not just when the log itself had focus. ([#57](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/57))
- On 2026.2, the committer name/email and date chips in the commit details panel could render as two overlapping icons instead of one, breaking the line-wrap point between them.

## [0.7.16] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- The commit details panel now renders issue-tracker references (e.g. `JIRA-123`) and plain URLs in commit descriptions as clickable links, using your IDE's Version Control → Issue Navigation settings. Clicking one opens it in your browser. ([#15](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/15))
- Double-clicking a commit in the log now shows its diff, and pressing Enter does the same — both are rebindable to a different action in Settings → Keymap. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- The log search field now matches a commit's Git hash (full or abbreviated), not just its change ID, description, or author. ([#44](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/44))
- New "Duplicate Change" and "Duplicate Onto..." actions in the log's right-click menu create an identical copy of the selected change(s), either in place or onto a chosen destination — works on immutable changes too. The "Duplicate Onto..." dialog hides destinations and disables placements that would fail because they'd need to rewrite an immutable commit. ([#33](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/33))

### Fixed
- Pushing a new or untracked bookmark no longer fails on jj 0.42 and later with "unexpected argument '--allow-new'". You're now asked to confirm before the new bookmark is created on the remote, same as before. ([#53](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/53))
- Pushing with the default "tracking bookmarks" scope no longer silently skips a brand-new bookmark with no feedback — you're now asked to confirm creating it on the remote, same as when pushing a specific bookmark.
- Background operations (e.g. Git push/fetch) that hit an unexpected internal error now report it instead of appearing to do nothing.
- The log graph now draws a merge commit's parents in the same left-to-right order as `jj log`, with matching line colors. Previously the parents could appear swapped (e.g. the trunk parent on the right) when a non-mainline parent happened to sit in the row directly below the merge. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- The commit log no longer shows a status icon on ordinary (mutable) revisions; only immutable revisions are marked, removing visual noise from the common case. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- Changing a log filter (reference/bookmark, author, date, text, or root) no longer deselects the current commit, or silently selects a different one, as long as it's still visible in the filtered list.
- Commit pickers in dialogs (Rebase, Squash Into..., Duplicate Onto..., Move Bookmark) now always show commits in the same order as the main log, instead of sometimes showing an unrelated order (e.g. an immutable root commit before the changes on top of it). This could happen the first time a dialog was opened for a repo, and — in multi-repo projects — could affect any repo unpredictably, because different repos' root commits share the same underlying jj change ID and were getting conflated when merging repos' logs.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- "Compare with Working Copy" in the log's right-click menu diffs every file that differs between the selected commit and your working copy, in one editor tab with the working-copy side editable — handy for reviewing everything since a target commit and editing it directly for a final `jj absorb`. ([#40](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/40))
- The References/Bookmarks selector above the log now also lists bookmarks that exist only on a remote and aren't tracked locally, shown as `name@remote` with a distinct icon, so you can start work off a remote branch without tracking it first. ([#47](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/47))
- New "Tracked" checkbox in the right-click menu for selected files (Project view, editor, Working Copy panel, Commit view) that match a `.gitignore` rule lets you force-include or stop tracking them, without touching `.gitignore` by hand. The checkbox updates instantly, and a notification confirms what happened (or explains why it didn't). ([#42](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/42))
- The commit details panel now shows the author's (and committer's, when different) email address alongside their name, as a clickable mail link, with the date/time kept together on one line when it wraps. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- New "New Change" quick action creates a change without prompting for a description upfront (the common case, since you'll usually squash it in later). It's the primary option in the log's right-click menu (the old dialog-based flow is kept as "New Change with Description..."), and is bound to Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N while the log is focused. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- New and Edit buttons in the log toolbar act on the selected change with one click, without opening the right-click menu. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- New "Fit Columns to Window Width" option (Columns menu) shrinks the description and other columns as the log window narrows so horizontal scrolling is rarely needed, e.g. on a laptop screen or with the details pane docked beside the log. On by default for tabs you haven't customized; tabs where you've already resized a column keep your exact layout and scrolling as before. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))

### Fixed
- Selecting a commit in the log no longer resets the table's horizontal scroll position. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- On a narrow log window, the filters no longer crowd out the New/Edit/Refresh/Fetch/Push/Columns buttons. Filters that don't fit collapse into a "»" menu instead, with any filter you've actually applied kept visible longer than ones you haven't. ([#51](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/51))
- The New button in the log toolbar now greys out instead of disappearing when there's no selection, matching how the Edit button already behaved.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- The plugin no longer bundles its own copy of the Kotlin standard library, reducing plugin size since the IDE already provides it. ([#41](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/41))
- Annotate (blame) no longer logs a spurious error when the project window is closed while an annotation is loading. ([#45](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/45))
- File-change actions (Open, Compare, Restore, etc.) no longer throw an error when a change from another VCS (e.g. Git in a colocated repository, or an unrelated VCS backend) is selected alongside or instead of a Jujutsu change. ([#50](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/50))

## [0.7.13] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- "Resolve Conflicts…" now appears (though disabled, with a hint to edit the change first) for a conflicted commit that isn't the working copy — including a commit that only inherits its conflict from an ancestor merge. Previously the option was hidden entirely, so there was no way to discover that the change could be resolved.
- The Working Copy tool window, and the "Resolve Conflicts…" actions, no longer show changes from Git in a repository that uses both Jujutsu and Git.

## [0.7.12] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Splitting allows selection of specific hunks within files.
- You can now support me to keep working on this plugin! See the *Sponsor this plugin** link at the bottom of **Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu**.

### Fixed
- Opening a file with F4 from the commit details or working-copy changes panel no longer logs a "Synchronous execution on EDT" error. The same fix covers Show Diff, Show Diff in New Tab, and Compare File with Branch when invoked from a changes selection.
- Filtering the commit log (by text, author, date, reference, or root) no longer leaves the graph lines misaligned or pointing at hidden commits. The graph layout is now recomputed from the visible subset whenever the filter changes, and the renderer is updated before Swing repaints so no intermediate misaligned state is shown.
- Resolving a conflict now updates the Working Copy panel automatically — previously the file kept showing as conflicted even after clicking Refresh, and trying to resolve it again would throw an error.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- A file newly created inside an ignored directory (e.g. matching a `.gitignore` pattern) now appears under "Ignored Files" in the Changes view immediately, without requiring a second edit to `.gitignore` to trigger a refresh.
- Opening a newly created ignored or unversioned file no longer produces a spurious warning in the IDE log.
- The ignored-file scan's slow-scan watchdog now reliably fires on directories containing very many files (previously it only checked elapsed time once per directory entered, so a single huge flat directory could block past the 5s threshold without ever showing the "scan is slow" notification). The watchdog now also aborts the in-progress scan when it fires, instead of letting it run to completion (GitHub #35).
- The log and working-copy view no longer fail to load entirely on jj backends that can't evaluate the `remote_bookmarks()` revset (e.g. some non-standard jj implementations). The plugin now falls back to loading the log without the "pushed to remote" decoration on affected repositories instead of crashing (GitHub #35).
- A commit with many bookmarks no longer hides the description or silently clips part of the bookmark list in the log table. Bookmarks/tags are now capped to half the column's width, with any overflow collapsed behind a clickable "+N more" chip that opens a popup of the hidden refs.
- The log row hover tooltip no longer gets clipped by the screen for commits with many bookmarks. It now reflows the bookmark list across multiple lines and scrolls if the content is taller than the screen, instead of cutting off the description and/or bookmarks.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- The "Compare with Another Commit…" popup and the working-copy switcher now accept arbitrary revision expressions (change id, git SHA, bookmark name) that fall outside the loaded log window. Typing a query that matches nothing locally shows a "Use … as revision" fallback, which resolves in the background and upgrades to a full commit preview, including the correct mutability icon.

### Changed
- Ignored-file scanning now runs asynchronously off the modified-file refresh path. Working-copy changes appear immediately after a save regardless of ignored-tree size; the Commit toolwindow shows the built-in "updating" indicator while ignored files are computed in the background.
- In multi-repository log windows, the repository color gutter is now expanded by default (showing the repo name) instead of collapsed to a thin colored strip, making per-repo colors easier to discover. Each log tab remembers your collapse/expand choice (GitHub #10).

### Fixed
- Bookmark and tag chips in the commit details panel no longer break apart when wrapping to multiple lines — the icon could previously be separated from its label, and long hyphenated names could break mid-word; each chip now wraps as a single atomic unit.
- Typing a revision that doesn't exist in the revision-choice popup or working-copy switcher no longer logs a WARN-level entry; resolution failures for a single typed revision are now logged at INFO, since this is an expected outcome rather than a plugin error.
- Mutable/immutable icon in the working-copy switcher and revision-choice popup now correctly reflects the target commit's immutability for bookmarks and tags, even when the target is outside the loaded log window.
- Resolving conflicts now refreshes the working copy so resolved files no longer appear conflicted in the panel; re-opening the Resolve dialog after a successful resolution no longer throws "Could not extract conflict data".

## [0.7.9] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Per-repository setting to disable ignored-file scanning (Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → expand the repository section). Useful for very large repositories where the scan causes a startup hang.
- Slow-scan watchdog: if the ignored-file walk exceeds 5 seconds, a notification appears offering to disable scanning for that repository or copy diagnostic stats to the clipboard for a bug report.

### Fixed
- Restoring a renamed or deleted file now correctly undoes the change. Previously, restoring a rename would delete the target file without recreating the source (leaving the working copy in a broken state), and deleted files could not be restored at all because the Restore action was hidden.
- `collectTrackedAbsolutePaths` no longer includes the `Parent commit (@-):` summary line as a phantom tracked path (status output without a blank line between sections).

## [0.7.8] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- Ignore scan no longer walks into ignored directories (e.g. `node_modules`, `build`) on every working-copy refresh. Ignored directories are now pruned at entry and reported as a single entry, fixing the multi-second stall and 10s shutdown hang reported in GitHub #35.
- Read-access error (`RuntimeExceptionWithAttachments`) no longer logged when showing a diff from the History view or using Compare with Local, Compare Before with Local, Open File, or Compare File with Branch actions.
- Working-copy switcher widget no longer paints doubled (two icons and two copies of the text).
- Filter components (reference, author, date) now show the correct X close icon immediately after IDE restart when a filter is active — previously the icon stayed as a dropdown arrow until the filter was interacted with.
- Status bar widget no longer throws an EDT-access exception on startup in projects with Jujutsu repositories.
- Working-copy panel no longer flickers or lags with 40+ changed files. Rapid file-save bursts (e.g. save-all over a large working copy) are coalesced into a single tree rebuild per 200ms window using `MergingUpdateQueue`, and bulk VFS events now issue a single batched `filesDirty()` call instead of one call per file.

### Changed
- Improved log performance when expanding context around a commit in large repositories.

### Added
- Multiple independent log windows: click the **+** button in the VCS tool window tab strip to open a new tab (all repos, default name). In projects with both Git and Jujutsu, the action appears in Git's existing "▼" dropdown. Right-click any Jujutsu log tab → **Rename…** to rename it inline. All filter state (search text, reference, author, date, root filter selection) and layout (column visibility, widths, details position) persists per-window across restarts.
- Tag create/set and delete actions (requires jj 0.37+): right-click a commit in the log to set a tag at that revision, or expand the "Tag" submenu to delete an existing tag. Right-clicking a tag chip directly also offers a delete action. Moving an existing tag prompts for confirmation. The bookmark and tag chip plumbing (URI scheme, hit-testing, popup dispatch) is now unified.
- Show repository roots in change trees and bookmark widget menus using coloured repository icons.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- jj tags now appear as decoration chips in the log table (Decorations column, inlined graph column, and commit details panel), the "Compare with Another Commit…" popup, and the working-copy switcher. Tags resolve as selectable revision targets alongside bookmarks, with a dedicated tag icon and a distinct green chip colour. A `jj tag list` cache ensures tags beyond the log limit are included in selectors.
- Tags in the working-copy switcher and revision selector now show the target commit's description alongside the tag name, matching the existing behaviour for bookmarks.

### Fixed
- Moving a file from a parent directory into a new child directory (e.g. `pages/{ => blankExperience}/blankExperience.tsx`) no longer causes the entire change to fail with "Invalid rename/copy format". Both sides of the `{old => new}` rename spec can now be empty, and the rename/copy parser is deduplicated into a single implementation.
- Typing in the "Compare with Commit" revision selector no longer freezes the UI on large repos. The cell renderer now reuses a single component instead of allocating a new one per cell (eliminating an O(n²) `ArrayList.indexOf` accumulation in `CellRendererPane`); list-model updates are applied in one batch call instead of one-at-a-time; per-render reflection (`IconSpec.javaField`) is hoisted to constants; and tag immutability is precomputed off the EDT instead of re-scanned linearly on each paint.
- Out-of-limit revisions loaded for navigation expansion (annotation-line click, parent change-ID click in the details panel) no longer render with empty Author and Date columns. `RepoLogCache` now fetches with the full log template so every cached entry carries author/committer signatures, matching the main log load.
- Reference filter (bookmark/tag dropdown in the log toolbar) now shows **all** bookmarks and tags regardless of the log limit. Selecting an out-of-limit reference automatically expands the log to include a context window around that commit (same behaviour as navigate-to-out-of-limit), then applies the filter normally. Selecting a tag or bookmark no longer mismatches when a tag and bookmark share the same name on different commits.
- Bookmark toolbar widget now shows **all** bookmarks regardless of the configured log limit; previously only bookmarks attached to loaded log entries were displayed (missing out-of-limit bookmarks in large repos).
- "Compare with Another Commit…" popup no longer runs `jj bookmark list` on every search keystroke; bookmarks are fetched once and filtered in memory, eliminating per-keystroke lag with 100+ bookmarks.
- `JujutsuAnnotationProvider.populateCache` no longer logs a spurious "control-flow exception" warning when the annotation preloader task fires after a project has begun disposing. The method now exits early on a disposed project and rethrows `ProcessCanceledException` so the platform can handle the race cleanly.
- "Compare with local" and "Compare before with local" no longer crash with a `VcsException` when the selected file does not exist in the current working copy (`@`). The diff now opens with an "(empty)" local side instead.
- `⌘D` / `Ctrl+D` in editor tabs no longer hijacks the Duplicate Line shortcut. `Jujutsu.ShowChangesDiff` now only activates on keyboard shortcut when there is an actual change or log selection in context; context-menu invocations are unaffected. The action promoter likewise only promotes the action over the built-in `Compare.SameVersion` when VCS or log data is present.
- **Show Diff** (`⌘D` / `Ctrl+D`) no longer throws a `VcsException` when invoked while a diff editor tab is focused. Synthetic diff-tab virtual files (`ChainDiffVirtualFile`) that have no Jujutsu VCS root are now silently skipped instead of causing an error.
- **Compare with Another Commit…** now works when invoked from inside a diff editor (previously a silent no-op). Focusing a diff side and invoking the action correctly opens the revision selector for that file.
- "Annotate Previous Revision" from the annotation gutter no longer shows a line-count mismatch warning. Previously the provider failed to recognise the revision type returned by `FileAnnotation.getRevisions()` and silently annotated at the working copy instead of the requested historical revision.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- `JujutsuVirtualFile.contentsToByteArray()` no longer calls `jj file show` while a ReadAction lock is held, eliminating the threading violation and potential UI freeze. When the platform requests content under read access with a cold cache, the call returns an empty array immediately and launches a background load; once that load completes it fires a VFS `contentsChanged` event so any open editor reloads automatically with the real content.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Navigating to a commit that is outside the configured log limit (e.g. clicking a parent change ID in the details panel or an annotation line) now expands the log to show a context window around the target commit and selects it. In multi-repository projects, each repo's expansion accumulates additively — expanding a commit in repo A then repo B shows both context windows together. Clicking the Refresh toolbar button returns the log to the configured limit view.

### Fixed
- Working copy changes no longer require a manual refresh to appear on startup. Two fixes: (1) the change provider skips `jj status` until the working copy state is loaded (eliminating a wasted invocation), and (2) the working copy panel now reads from the `ChangeListManager` cache when it connects to `workingCopies`, so changes are visible immediately even if the panel was created after the initial VCS scan completed.
- Fixed a memory leak reported on IDE shutdown: `JujutsuCommitDetailsPanel` was registered in the Disposer tree under `ROOT_DISPOSABLE` instead of its owning panel, causing a `RuntimeException` on quit.
- Diff views for mutable revisions no longer show stale content after the revision is edited: cached file bytes are invalidated on `logRefresh` and re-fetched lazily on next access.

### Changed
- Git remote lookup is now backed by `NotifiableState` (consistent with working copy and repository state) instead of a per-repository `CompletableFuture`. Remotes are refreshed whenever the repository set changes, and BGT callers are guaranteed a loaded result via `immediateValue` rather than silently receiving an empty list during startup.
- Rebase, squash, move-bookmark, and revision-picker dialogs now open without issuing extra `jj log` calls when the main log is already loaded — they reuse the cached commit data instead.
- Single-revision lookups via `getLogEntry` now route through the in-memory `LogCache` for `ChangeId`, `CommitId`, and `BookmarkName` targets, falling back to a targeted `jj log -r` shell-out only on a cache miss or unknown revision type. Removed the dead `repositoryStates` state (superseded by `workingCopies`) and eliminated the redundant `jj log` fetch fired when the working-copy panel binds to a repository (the cached working copy entry from `workingCopies` is already applied by the `boundRepository` setter).
- The status-bar working-copy switcher resolves bookmark and commit-ID selections from the cache on a cache hit, avoiding an extra `jj log` call per switch.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Cmd+D / Ctrl+D on a selected log entry now opens the native diff preview — the same embedded tree+diff view you get by double-clicking a file in the commit details panel, with directory grouping and a `"abc1234: FileName.kt"` tab title. The action is also available in the log table's right-click context menu. "Open in New Tab" opens a standalone chain-viewer tab and likewise now works from a selected log entry.

### Fixed
- Toggling Description, Change ID, Status, or Decorations in the Columns menu now correctly shows or hides that content in the log view, rather than adding a duplicate column.
- Copied files are no longer shown as merge conflicts in the working copy panel. They now appear as rename-style entries (source → destination) and are correctly shown in commit history.
- Split, Rebase, Squash Into, and Squash From dialogs no longer silently fail when the relevant changes are not currently visible in the log (e.g. outside the display limit or filtered by the active revset). The Split preview graph now also appears when Split is opened from the Changes view.
- Squash Into, Squash From, and Rebase destination/source pickers now populate immediately when the dialog opens.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Selecting an immutable change in the status-bar working-copy switcher no longer fails with "Commit … is immutable". The switcher now queries jj directly for the selected revision's immutability (no longer limited to the 10 most recent changes), acts on the commit id to avoid divergent-change ambiguity, and shows a confirmation dialog before switching. Immutable items are also dimmed with a lock icon in the popup.

### Changed
- Status-bar working-copy widget now renders a full styled row (commit icon + change ID + truncated description) via the shared `TextCanvas` renderer, replacing the plain-text display. The widget is no longer built on the internal `DvcsStatusWidget` API and now uses `CustomStatusBarWidget` for proper platform integration. Widget refresh is coalesced into a single handler and is freeze-safe; a `FileEditorManagerListener` updates the displayed repository when switching files in multi-root projects.

### Added
- A bookmark management widget now appears in the log toolbar. In single-repo projects it shows the current working-copy bookmark name(s) and opens a dropdown with per-bookmark sub-menus (Create, Rename, Delete, Forget; remote bookmarks folded in as Track/Untrack). In multi-repo projects the label is blank and the dropdown groups bookmarks under one sub-menu per repository, with "Create Bookmark Here…" scoped to each repo's working copy.
- A working-copy switcher widget now appears in the bottom-right status bar for JJ-managed projects. It shows the current local bookmark name, falling back to the change description or `(no description set)`. Clicking opens a speed-searchable popup listing local bookmarks at the top, then up to 10 recent changes; bookmarks and changes are rendered with the same icons, colors, and styled IDs as the "Compare with Another Commit…" revision selector. Selecting an item shows a confirmation dialog to choose **Edit** or **New on Top** (`jj edit` / `jj new`); immutable targets offer only New on Top. The widget auto-refreshes reactively via the state model and hides for non-JJ projects.
- Log table now correctly shows pending-deletion bookmarks: entries carrying a remote bookmark (e.g. `main@origin`) whose local counterpart has been deleted now display the deleted local (`main` with strikethrough) at that commit, and the remote no longer shows a spurious large ahead count.
- Pending-deletion bookmarks (bookmarks deleted locally but still present on the remote) now appear in the "Specific bookmark" dropdown in the push dialog, shown with strikethrough and a "(deleted)" label. The confirmation dialog before a push now also warns when pending deletions will be included.
- Bookmark decorations now show pending deletions (strikethrough), local/remote divergence (↑n ↓n), and bookmark conflicts (conflict icon) in the log gutter, graph column decorations, and commit details panel.
- "Forget" context menu action on local bookmarks: removes a bookmark locally without creating a pending remote deletion. A confirmation dialog explains that the bookmark will reappear on the next fetch.
- "Move Bookmark Here…" opens a searchable dialog that classifies bookmarks into Forward and Backward/Sideways sections with directional icons and full-width section dividers. Forward bookmarks can be selected immediately; backward or sideways moves are shown at 50% opacity and require checking "Allow backward or sideways move" to enable selection. If the repository state changes between opening the dialog and confirming, a fallback prompt handles the race condition.
- Bookmark chips in the log table (Decorations column and inlined graph/description column) are now interactive: hovering shows a hand cursor, left-clicking navigates the log to the change that bookmark points at, and right-clicking opens a per-bookmark context menu with Rename, Delete, Forget, Track/Untrack, and Move To… actions.
- Bookmark chips in the commit details panel are now interactive with the same left-click navigation and right-click context menu.
- "Move \<bookmark\> To…" context menu action: opens a searchable change-picker dialog showing candidate destinations classified as Forward (descendants) or Backward (ancestors), with an "Allow backward move" checkbox to gate ancestor selection.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- "Show Diff in New Tab" context menu action on file-change trees: opens a fresh diff editor tab each time, allowing multiple diffs to be open simultaneously alongside the reusable preview tab.
- Diff preview editor tabs now show context in their title: working copy diffs show `@: filename`, log-detail diffs show `<short-change-id>: filename`, and multi-selection shows the count (e.g. `3 changes: filename`).

### Fixed
- Double-clicking a file in the working copy or log details file-change tree now opens a diff preview editor tab. Subsequent single-clicks on other files swap the diff content in the same tab rather than opening new tabs. Escape closes the preview. Cmd/Ctrl+D routes through the same preview tab when invoked from these panels.
- Single-clicking a file in the working copy panel no longer opens a new editor tab on every click.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- "Squash Into Here from..." action in the log context menu: right-click on a destination change to pick one or more source changes to fold into it via `jj squash --from ... --into ...`. This is the inverse of "Squash from Here into..." — destination is pre-selected, sources are chosen. The working copy is pre-selected as a source when it is mutable. Supports multi-source selection, partial file selection, description combining, and the delete/move working-copy option.

### Changed
- Squash dialogs no longer automatically move the working copy to the destination after a squash. A new "Delete empty source change and move working copy to destination" checkbox gives explicit control over this behaviour; the last-used state is persisted per project and defaults to unchecked (matching vanilla `jj squash` semantics).

### Fixed
- "Squash Into…" destination picker now includes descendants of the source change. Previously descendants were incorrectly excluded (using rebase cycle-prevention logic that does not apply to squash).
- Squash dialogs no longer send `--message` when jj would handle the description naturally. Descriptions are now only combined and sent when both the source and destination have non-empty descriptions and the squash is full (source will be abandoned). For partial squashes the destination description is left unchanged.
- Log column widths are now correctly persisted across sessions. Previously, programmatic width assignments during panel initialization were triggering the save listener and overwriting user-adjusted widths with defaults before they could be restored.
- "Squash into Parent…" is now enabled for merge commits. The dialog shows a destination picker restricted to the source's mutable parents; the user picks which parent to squash into. Previously the action was silently disabled for any commit with more than one parent.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Files matching `.gitignore` patterns (e.g. `build/`, `.gradle/`) are now grayed out in the Project tool window and listed in the "Ignored Files" node of Local Changes, matching the behavior of the Git plugin. Ignore rules are re-evaluated automatically when `.gitignore` or `.git/info/exclude` changes.
- "Squash from Here into..." action in the log context menu: squash one or more selected mutable changes into an arbitrary destination change via `jj squash --from ... --into ...`. Supports multi-source selection, file-level selection, description editing (auto-populated from destination + sources), and a keep-emptied option. The destination picker searches by change ID, description, or bookmark name and excludes invalid targets.
- Fetch dialog with repository and remote selection: when multiple repos or remotes are configured, Fetch now opens a dialog to choose which repository (or all) and which remote (default, specific, or all remotes) to fetch from

## [0.6.12] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- "Open Local File" action in the log detail panel and editor context menu: opens the working copy version of a file when viewing a historical revision

### Fixed
- Historical file editor tabs no longer lose their change ID suffix when the local version of the same file is opened
- Ctrl+D from the project tree now correctly shows parent vs working copy diff instead of two identical sides

### Changed
- Revision selector allows for search by commit id

## [0.6.10] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- Pressing Cmd+K in a Jujutsu project now opens the Describe Working Copy dialog instead of IntelliJ's commit dialog

### Fixed
- Changes/Commit tool window no longer disappears in mixed Jujutsu+Git projects
- Cmd+K (commit shortcut) is disabled in Jujutsu-only projects where it previously silently discarded the commit message; in mixed Jujutsu+Git projects, Jujutsu changes now show a clear error instead of being silently dropped
- Push dialog "Tracking bookmarks (default)" option now works correctly when new bookmarks need to be created on the remote — after the user confirms, the push proceeds with `--allow-new`
- Fetch action no longer throws an EDT threading error when clicked
- Show History now brings the VCS tool window to the front

## [0.6.9] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Conflict resolution: conflicted files detected via `jj resolve --list` appear in red (MERGED_WITH_CONFLICTS) in the working copy panel
- Three-way merge dialog opens on conflicted files showing ours / base / theirs; supports bulk Accept Yours / Accept Theirs
- "Resolve Conflicts…" context menu action scoped to the selected files in the working copy panel, or the focused file in the editor; only visible when the selection contains conflicted files
- Conflicted files now appear highlighted in the log details pane when a conflicted commit is selected
- "Resolve Conflicts…" in the log row context menu for the working copy entry when conflicts are present
- "Resolve Conflicts…" in the log details pane changes tree for working copy entries

### Fixed
- Conflict marker parsing handles all three jj formats — snapshot (`+++++++`), diff (`%%%%%%%`), and git (`|||||||`/`=======`) — including the git format introduced as the default in jj 0.37

## [0.6.9] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- "Open in Remote" now appears in the working copy panel context menu and resolves to the nearest pushed ancestor
- "Open in Remote" for historical file editors now correctly resolves unpushed commits to their nearest pushed ancestor instead of using the commit hash directly (which would produce a broken URL)

## [0.6.8] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- "Open File in Remote" no longer causes IDE errors when hovering the context menu in large repos (eliminated synchronous jj subprocess call from action update)
- Diff on a directory opens diff views on all changed files under that directory
- Cmd+D (Show Diff) now works in working copy tool window regardless of which component has focus
- Compare with Local, Compare Before with Local, and Restore to This now appear and work in historical file editors
- Compare with Another Commit now appears in the changes tree context menu (details panel and working copy panel)
- Restore to This registered in editor Jujutsu menu
- Restore (working copy) correctly hidden in historical file editor context
- Jujutsu editor submenu grouped with separators matching the commit details panel layout

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Jujutsu context menu available when viewing historical file versions
- Show diff for historical change
- Compare historical change with another commit
- Custom history provider replaces built-in VCS history tabs

### Fixed
- Diffs, change lists, and annotation gutters now show the correct base content for merge commits, using the auto-merged parent tree instead of the first parent's content
- Diffs work for files that have been renamed
- Open in Remote finds last pushed revision
- Restore Selection action no longer evaluates repository resolution unnecessarily when hidden in historical context

### Changed
- "Restore to This" now supports multiple file selections
- Removed spurious opening of files from working copy window when selecting a file
- Consolidated "Open File" and "Open Repository Version"
- Split and squash actions consolidated for working copy and historical revisions
- Open in Remote works for multiple files

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- Annotation gutter now shows the change ID column by default, coloured in the plugin's change ID blue
- Annotation tooltips are now formatted HTML: change ID, commit ID, author · date, and description — matching the log row tooltip style
- Log row tooltip now includes author · date above the description
- Commit details panel now shows author · date using absolute timestamps; committer date also shown when different from author

### Fixed
- ENTER key no longer hijacks global IDE navigation (e.g. Find Usages); the Jujutsu changes tree handles ENTER locally
- Clicking an annotation gutter column now correctly navigates the log to that change
- Annotation "View Colors" now works — lines from the same change share a background colour, and "Color by Author" groups by author
- Annotation "View Names" / "Email" modes now work correctly — name shortening (initials, first/last name, email) is applied when toggled
- Annotation no longer shows a "line count mismatch" warning when the working copy has local changes; the annotation now targets `@-` (the parent), matching IntelliJ's line status tracker base
- "Annotate Previous Revision" now loads file content correctly, including for files opened in historical annotation tabs

### Changed
- Repository icon colours are now consistent with IDE folders

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Describe dialog no longer shows a literal `{0}` placeholder in the prompt; it now correctly shows the change ID being described
- Deleting a remote bookmark no longer shows an error dialog with a missing resource string. Remote bookmarks (e.g. `main@origin`) no longer offer Delete or Rename actions; only Track/Untrack is offered for remote bookmarks
- Diffs from merge working copies no longer fail. Previously, comparing against `@-` was ambiguous when the working copy had multiple parents, causing "cannot load diff" errors or showing files as entirely new. Now resolves to the first parent's change id from cached state

### Changed
- Marketplace description expanded to surface additional shipped features: compare with branch/revision, restore files, configurable revsets with Test button, per-repository setting overrides, push safety (non-fast-forward and sideways move warnings), multi-select in log, rebase post-rebase preview, split's dual-tree UI, Show History for Selection, and colocate option in clone/init
- Roadmap trimmed: "Open in Remote" removed (shipped in 0.6.2/0.6.3); "Squash & Split from File Selection" narrowed to remaining destination-picker + hunk work; "Remote Bookmark Management" narrowed to branches panel and bookmark toolbar widget

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Push now warns before performing sideways (non-fast-forward) bookmark moves. A confirmation dialog lists the affected bookmarks and requires explicit approval before force-pushing

### Fixed
- Plugin no longer crashes on startup when the system PATH contains entries with invalid characters (e.g. `Dev:\sdks\flutter\`); invalid entries are now skipped with a warning logged

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- "Open in Remote" now works in editors opened via "Open Repository Version": the editor correctly resolves its repository and opens the file at the pinned historical commit rather than the latest pushed ancestor
- "Open in Remote" now appears in diff viewer right-click menus (Show Diff, Compare with Local, Compare Before with Local). Both the local and historical sides are supported: the historical side opens the file at the exact commit shown, while the local side opens at the latest pushed ancestor
- "Open in Remote" now includes the current line or selection as a URL fragment (`#L42`, `#L42-L50`). When opening a working-copy file, local line numbers are mapped to the corresponding remote lines using a diff of the local and pushed content

### Fixed
- Modified and added files now appear correctly in Local Changes and Working Copy. Previously, a spurious VFS cache check caused them to be silently dropped in large projects (or any project where IntelliJ's VFS scan was still in progress when changes were first detected), leaving only deleted files visible (fixes #19)

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- "Open in GitHub" / "Open in GitLab" action in the commit log context menu and file history toolbar. Supports github.com and gitlab.com remotes (SSH and HTTPS). Shows a submenu when multiple recognized remotes are configured. File history additionally offers "Open File" to navigate to the specific file at that revision. Tooltip warns when the commit has not been detected on the remote.

### Fixed
- Annotation and diff providers no longer race with startup: the repository cache is guaranteed warm before IntelliJ activates VCS
- Describe button now correctly enables when typing into an empty (undescribed) working copy
- Descriptions no longer accumulate a trailing blank line on each describe: jj's storage newline is stripped on read, and intentional trailing blank lines are preserved
- Uninitialised Jujutsu repository notification now navigates to the Directory Mappings settings page

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Multi-select in log: changes tree now shows the union of all selected commits' changes (chained by file path, oldest-to-newest)
- Multi-select in log: metadata pane shows each selected commit's details stacked with separators (capped at 20, with overflow label)
- Change ID in commit details panel is now a clickable link that selects that single commit in the log

### Removed
- "UI Preferences" settings group containing three non-functional checkboxes (auto-refresh, short change ID format, auto-open log tab) — these settings were stored but never read

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Push from a specific log entry now scopes the operation to that revision: bookmark list is filtered to ancestors of the selected change, and `jj git push -r <revision>` is used for the default push scope

### Fixed
- Push dialog now includes a repository selector when multiple repositories are open, pre-selected from file context
- "Specific bookmark" dropdown in the push dialog is now disabled unless that radio button is selected
- Pushing a new (untracked) local bookmark no longer fails with "Refusing to create new remote bookmark" — `--allow-new` is passed automatically
- Push and fetch now show a clear warning notification instead of failing cryptically when no Git remote is configured

## [0.5.21] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Spurious WARN log entries for `jj config get` (key not found is normal) and `jj file annotate` (caller already logs failures)
- Annotating an empty file no longer shows an error dialog
- Fixed repository detection for single-repository projects (regression introduced in 0.5.20)
- "Configure VCS roots..." link now navigates correctly to VCS directory mappings settings (previously opened last-visited settings page due to wrong configurable ID) (GitHub #20)

## [0.5.20] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Test button for revset expressions in Log Settings — validates against each repo and shows change count
- Per-repo Test button for revset overrides in Repository Settings
- Revset validation on apply — prevents saving invalid expressions

### Fixed
- Root filter now appears in log toolbar for multi-repo projects (GitHub #10)
- Repository names in multi-repo projects now use simple directory names if they are unambiguous (Github #10 part 3)

## [0.5.18] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- User Identity section in Settings → Jujutsu for editing global `user.name` / `user.email`
- Repository Settings section in Settings → Jujutsu with one collapsible group per repo — all repos visible and configurable simultaneously, no switching required
- Startup now checks user config per-repo using each repo's own executor, so repo-scoped config is recognised
- User config notification now links directly to Settings → Jujutsu for configuration
- Repository Settings identity section auto-detects existing repo-scoped overrides (via `jj config get --repo`)

### Fixed
- `jj config get` now runs in repo context, picking up repo-scoped config (GitHub #9)
- Changed jj executable path in settings now takes effect immediately without IDE restart
- Upgrading jj binary in-place (same path) now detected when clicking Test button, refreshing working copy and log automatically

## [0.5.16] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- JJ executable path is now a global (application-level) setting, shared across all projects. Existing custom paths are automatically migrated.
- Settings architecture uses three tiers: global (app), project, and per-repository overrides
- Working copy and log panels show "Checking jj..." instead of "jj Not Found" during startup availability check

### Fixed
- Describe working copy no longer throws write-only access error (Github #8)

## [0.5.15] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Truncation indicator in log panel when the entry count hits the limit, with a clickable link to open settings
- Log automatically reloads when the limit setting is changed

### Fixed
- Support custom jj builds with version strings like "jj companyname-0.39.0-..." (GitHub #7)
- Conflicted bookmarks no longer break lists of all bookmarks

### Changed
- Default log limit increased from 50 to 500, with automatic migration for existing users who never changed the default

## [0.5.14] - 2026-04-02

## [0.5.13] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- User feedback after successful push — now shows a notification with the push output
- Can now push untracked bookmarks

### Fixed
- Respect remote and bookmark selections when pushing to remote

## [0.5.12] - 2026-04-01

## [0.5.11] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Roadmap of upcoming features
- Squash/split from file context menus: right-click files in working copy panel, commit details, project view, or editor to squash into parent or split into a new change with those files pre-selected
- Track/untrack remote bookmarks: right-click a remote bookmark in the log context menu to track or untrack it
- Visual distinction between tracked (filled) and untracked (outline) bookmark icons in the log and push dialog

### Fixed
- UI freeze when VCS operations triggered from modal dialogs (e.g., push dialog) by propagating correct modality state to async callbacks
- Project view and editors now refresh after VCS operations (edit, new, abandon, rebase, squash, split, fetch) that change working copy files on disk

### Changed
- Resized mutable/immutable icons in the log to be less prominent

## [0.5.10] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Git clone with Jujutsu: Clone Git repositories directly from File > New > Project from Version Control using `jj git clone`
- Initial jj setup: Prompt to configure user.name and user.email when jj is detected but not configured, pre-populating from git global config

## [0.5.9] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- jj installation detection: Plugin now detects jj in PATH and common installation locations (Homebrew, Cargo, Scoop, Chocolatey, Winget, Snap, APT)
- jj availability notifications: Shows helpful guidance when jj is not found, version is too old (requires 0.37.0+), or configured path is invalid
- Installation guidance: Notifications include one-click actions to copy install/upgrade commands or open documentation

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Settings changes (jj executable path) now take effect immediately without IDE restart ([#4](https://github.com/kkkev/jj-idea/issues/4))
