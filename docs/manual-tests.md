# Manual Test Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive manual test checklist for the Jujutsu IDE plugin. These
tests require GUI interaction and should be verified manually using `./gradlew runIde`.

Use this checklist:
- Before releases, as a full regression pass
- When verifying feature parity with standard VCS logs
- When onboarding new contributors to understand expected behavior
- **After a change, to re-run only the affected sections** — see [How to scope a run](#how-to-scope-a-run)

## How to Run Manual Tests

1. Start the IDE with the plugin: `./gradlew runIde`
2. Open a project with a Jujutsu repository (or create one with `jj git init`)
3. For a full pass, work through every section below. For a change, scope to the affected
   sections first (see below) — the full list is too large to run for every PR.

## How to scope a run

Each section's **Code:** line is the blast-radius map. To scope a run: list the files your
change touched → `grep -n 'Code:' docs/manual-tests.md` for each → check
[Shared Surfaces](#shared-surfaces) and each match's **Also re-run:** line → run the union.
See contributing.md § "Manual regression scope as a deliverable" for how this feeds a PR report.

## Fixtures

Shared setup, referenced by ID instead of repeated inline. Each fixture is a runnable script
under `scripts/fixtures/` rather than an embedded snippet — run it, then open the printed
directory as a project in the plugin IDE (`./gradlew runIde`).

| ID | Script | Creates |
|---|---|---|
| FX-STACK | `scripts/fixtures/fx-stack.sh [target-dir]` | Linear stack base → A → B → C (@ = C), for squash testing |
| FX-CONFLICT | `scripts/fixtures/fx-conflict.sh [target-dir] [marker-style] [wc-position]` | A content conflict on `file.txt` (change A rebased onto change B); `marker-style` is `git` (default), `snapshot`, or `diff` — rerun with a different style against the same repo to test all three. `wc-position` is `conflicted` (default, working copy on the conflict) or `sibling` (working copy on change B, a clean commit unrelated to the conflict — GitHub #119 / jj-idea-ct7e's repro position) |
| FX-MD-CONFLICT | `scripts/fixtures/fx-md-conflict.sh [target-dir]` | A modify/delete conflict on `a.txt` — one side deletes the file entirely, so "accept" on that side must remove it from disk, not leave an empty file; a different case from FX-CONFLICT's content conflict |
| FX-STRESS | `scripts/fixtures/fx-stress.sh [target-dir]` | A ~1084-commit repo with ~26 concurrent heads (main trunk, 20 short feature branches, 5 long branches, a 200-commit deep-branch, an octopus-merge, a hotfix/* cluster), for log-graph/filter stress testing. Reused as `jj-stress-test` by MT-LOG-GRAPH's stress bullet and its "Graph layout under filtering" subsection, and by MT-LOG-FILTER's Reference filter fixture — don't build a separate throwaway multi-branch repo for those, this one already has far more lanes than any of them need. Two env knobs for larger-scale work (jj-idea-2c8k): `SCALE=<n>` multiplies the main trunk / deep-branch / long-branch lengths (e.g. `SCALE=6` for ~7,000 commits, matching GitHub #69's repo size), and `WITH_REMOTE=1` pushes `main` and a few branch bookmarks to a bare repo created alongside the target, so `remote_bookmarks()` is non-empty — a plain `jj git init` leaves it empty, which makes the log template's `hasPushedAncestor` predicate (`descendants(::remote_bookmarks())`) trivially cheap and would understate its real cost |

Each script fails loudly (non-zero exit, explanatory message) if the jj version installed
produces a different topology than expected, rather than silently leaving a broken fixture —
see each script's header comment for the specific invariant it checks.

## Test Tooling

**Multiple jj versions.** Version-gated features (`jj/JjFeature.kt`, `jj/JjVersion.MINIMUM`)
need testing against both a jj new enough to support the feature and one that isn't. Keep
`jj` on `PATH` at whatever's newest (e.g. `brew upgrade jj` on macOS); pin specific other
versions alongside it with `scripts/jj-install-version.sh`:

```bash
scripts/jj-install-version.sh 0.39.0   # -> ~/.local/bin/jj-0.39.0, jj-0.39
scripts/jj-install-version.sh 0.37.0   # -> ~/.local/bin/jj-0.37.0, jj-0.37
```

Downloads the matching prebuilt release binary for the current platform from
[jj-vcs/jj releases](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/releases). To exercise the plugin against
a pinned version: **Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → JJ executable path**, point it at
e.g. `~/.local/bin/jj-0.39`, then **Test**. Clear the field (or point it back at plain `jj`)
to return to default resolution. See contributing.md § "Testing against multiple jj
versions" and MT-BOOKMARK's "Version gating" checklist for the scenario this was built for.

## Known gaps

Not checkboxes — just a reminder of what's known-missing so you don't file a duplicate bug:

- **jj-idea-7d9p** — "Compare with Another Commit" missing from Details Changes Panel / Working Copy Panel.
- **jj-idea-zvzk** — "Compare with local" missing from editors for historical versions.
- **jj-idea-ddcd** — native Commit tool window's "Resolve" link discards a side on cancel; use jj-idea's own "Resolve Conflicts…" entries instead, never this one.

## Test Sections

### MT-LOG-TABLE

**Log table selection, navigation, and row interaction**

**Code:** `ui/log/JujutsuLogTable.kt`, `ui/log/UnifiedJujutsuLogPanel.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuColumnManager.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuLogContextMenuActions.kt`, `ui/log/LogClickTarget.kt`, `ui/components/TextCanvas.kt`, `ui/components/LogEntryText.kt` (`appendBookmarks`, `bookmarkRefChips`, jj-idea-e4ln's `@git` filter), `ui/log/JujutsuLogTableDnD.kt`, `ui/dnd/` (payload/target model, zone geometry, guards, dispatch), `ui/log/JujutsuCustomLogTabManager.kt`, `actions/top/OpenJujutsuLogTabAction.kt`
**Also re-run:** MT-LOG-DETAILS (issue-tracker link rendering is shared with the details panel)

#### Entry points (jj-idea-biqp, GitHub #118)

- [ ] With the Version Control tool window closed/hidden, **VCS → Jujutsu → Open Jujutsu Log**
      opens it, focused on the Jujutsu log tab
- [ ] With the log tab already open but the tool window hidden (e.g. another tool window has
      focus, or it was collapsed), re-invoking **Open Jujutsu Log** (from the menu, the VCS
      Operations popup, or its keymap shortcut if bound) brings the tool window to the front and
      selects the tab — it does not create a second/duplicate log tab
- [ ] The VCS Operations popup (Ctrl/Cmd+`) shows "Open Jujutsu Log" near the top of the Jujutsu
      section
- [ ] In a plain Git (non-jj) project, the "Jujutsu" VCS submenu is absent and the VCS Operations
      popup shows only Git's entries — no "Open Jujutsu Log" leaks in

#### Selection & navigation

- [ ] Basic selection and navigation all work: single-click select, Shift+click range,
      Ctrl/Cmd+click non-contiguous, Up/Down arrows, Page Up/Down, Home/End
- [ ] Selection persists after filtering (if entry still visible): select a commit, then clear or
      change each of the reference/bookmark, author, date, text, and root filters in turn while the
      commit stays visible throughout — the selection (and the details panel content) never
      flickers to empty and stays on the same commit each time (jj-idea-yje9)
- [ ] Selection clears when filtered entry is hidden: select a commit, then apply a filter that
      excludes it — the selection clears and the details panel shows its empty state (jj-idea-yje9)
- [ ] On a narrow window with horizontal scroll active (scrolled right so later columns are
      visible), selecting a commit (click, arrow keys, ref-chip click, a details-panel parent
      link click, or a log refresh) does not reset horizontal scroll position (jj-idea-f27g)
- [ ] Clicking a parent/change-id link in the commit details panel (or working copy panel)
      selects that commit in the log and it stays selected (no flicker/deselect); if the
      linked commit is beyond the log limit, the log expands to include it (jj-idea-f27g)
- [ ] Select a change that's outside the log window (so expansion is needed), then in a terminal
      `jj abandon` it (or squash it into its parent) before the log refreshes — refresh the log
      (and refresh again): no "Uncaught exception" error dialog appears, the selection is simply
      dropped, and selecting another off-window change still expands normally afterwards
      (GitHub #76)
- [ ] Ctrl/Cmd+C on a selected row copies the change ID (or file path, when a file is selected)
- [ ] Delete on a selected change abandons it, with a confirmation dialog first
- [ ] F2 on a selected change renames/describes it (opens the describe dialog)

#### Double-click / Enter on a log row (jj-idea-th9h)

- [ ] Select a commit row and press Enter → that commit's diff opens (Show Diff)
- [ ] Double-click a commit row (not on a bookmark/tag chip or the root gutter) → the same
      diff opens
- [ ] Double-click a bookmark or tag chip → does nothing (no diff opens, no filter change,
      jj-idea-wkcz — bookmark/tag chips have no left-click action, only a right-click menu)
- [ ] Double-click the "+N more" overflow chip → shows the hidden-refs popup (no diff opens)
- [ ] jj-idea-e4ln (GitHub #120): in a **colocated** repo, a bookmark shows only its local chip
      and any real-remote chip(s) in the log row — no separate `@git` chip, matching the
      bookmarks panel (which already hides the `git` group, see MT-BOOKMARK); the "+N more"
      overflow count and its hidden-refs popup also never include `@git`
- [ ] Double-click the root gutter column (multi-repo view) → toggles expansion (no diff opens)
- [ ] In Settings → Keymap, rebind "Show Diff" off Enter onto a different jj action (or clear
      it) → both Enter and double-click on a log row now follow the new binding

#### Hover tooltip behaviour (jj-idea-wp12)

**Code:** `ui/components/IconAwareTooltip.kt`

- [ ] In Settings → Version Control → Issue Navigation, add a pattern (as above) so a commit's
      row tooltip contains a clickable issue-tracker link; hover that row until the tooltip
      appears, then move the pointer up into the tooltip — it stays open (does not disappear)
- [ ] With the tooltip open, click the issue-tracker link inside it → opens in your browser;
      click the author's name (a `mailto:` link) → opens your mail client
- [ ] With the tooltip open, select some of its text with the mouse (click-drag) — the text
      highlights instead of the tooltip disappearing on the first move
- [ ] With the tooltip open, move the pointer sideways or away from it (not towards it) → it
      dismisses normally
- [ ] Hover a row so the tooltip appears, then scroll the log (mouse wheel, scrollbar drag, or
      Page Up/Down) without moving the pointer — the tooltip disappears immediately and does
      **not** reappear while the pointer stays still; move the pointer afterwards — the tooltip
      reappears with the *new* row under the pointer (not stale content from before the scroll)
- [ ] Move the pointer between adjacent rows without ever entering the tooltip — content still
      updates to match each row as before
- [ ] Move the pointer off the log table onto another tool window or editor — the tooltip
      dismisses
- [ ] jj-idea-lgo4: off-switch for this tooltip — see "View options menu" below

#### Column management

- [ ] jj-idea-rozx: no blank header row above the log table (GitHub #78) - the table starts
      directly under the toolbar
- [ ] Column visibility toggle (View Options menu) still works
- [ ] Resize a column by dragging its border directly in the rows (matches Git's log - no visible
      header row to grab). Reorder a column by dragging it horizontally; a mostly-vertical drag
      doesn't start a reorder. Double-clicking a border no longer auto-fits it
- [ ] The root gutter (leftmost) column can't be resized or dragged to reorder
- [ ] Date (rightmost) can be resized by dragging its right edge, same as any other column, and
      isn't noticeably narrower than the other fixed columns with "Fit columns to window width" on
- [ ] Column widths and visibility both persist across IDE restarts
- [ ] With drag-and-drop preview enabled (jj-idea-vpvz): a mostly-vertical drag on a commit row
      still starts a commit drag/drop (e.g. rebase), not a column reorder

#### View options menu (jj-idea-lgo4, n22a)

The toolbar's eye-icon button opens a single flat "View Options" popup (replacing the old,
separate "Columns" and "Details Position" submenus) with labeled section headers: **Columns**
(the per-column toggles, then a plain separator, then "Fit Columns to Window Width" - a layout
behavior rather than a column), **Details** (Right/Bottom), and an unlabeled trailing group with
**Alternating Row Colors** and **Hover Tooltips** (renamed from "Commit Tooltips", jj-idea-uyu9,
since the same setting now also gates the bookmarks panel's own row tooltip - see
[Bookmark-state tooltips](#bookmark-state-tooltips-jj-idea-uyu9-github-110)).

- [ ] Toolbar shows one eye-icon **View Options** button (no separate Columns / Details Position
      buttons). Opening it shows "Columns" and "Details" section headers with the expected items
      grouped underneath, and "Alternating Row Colors" / "Hover Tooltips" at the bottom, both
      checked by default
- [ ] Uncheck **Hover Tooltips**, then hover a log row — no tooltip appears; re-check it —
      hovering again shows the tooltip, no restart needed. Repeat in a file-history tab and in
      the **Working copy** tool window (same table, same global setting) — toggling it in one
      table's menu updates all of them immediately
- [ ] Uncheck **Alternating Row Colors** — log window rows become uniform, no restart needed;
      open the Duplicate, Squash-into, and Rebase dialogs — their destination/source picker
      tables are also unstriped (they read the same global setting when opened). Re-check and
      confirm striping returns everywhere, including in tables/tabs opened while it was off
- [ ] Column visibility, Fit Columns to Window Width, and Details Right/Bottom toggles all still
      work exactly as before from this flattened menu

#### Responsive column sizing (jj-idea-lzq7)

- [ ] Open a fresh log tab (or one where you've never dragged a column). The View Options menu's
      "Fit Columns to Window Width" is checked by default. Drag the tool window narrow: the
      description column shrinks and no horizontal scrollbar appears until the window is very
      narrow; author/date visibly narrow (and ellipsize) before any scrollbar appears
- [ ] With that tab still narrow, dock the commit-details pane to the right (Details position):
      the table re-fits to the remaining width with no scrollbar; widen the window back out and
      the columns grow back
- [ ] In a tab with a column you dragged before this change shipped (or drag one now, then
      reopen the tab), "Fit Columns to Window Width" defaults to unchecked and the layout/
      scrollbar behavior is exactly as before
- [ ] Toggle "Fit Columns to Window Width" off and on in the View Options menu; behavior switches
      between responsive and manual immediately, and the choice persists across closing and
      reopening the tab
- [ ] With fit-to-width on, manually widen the author column via drag, then narrow the window:
      the chosen author width is remembered (the column returns to it on widen) and persists
      across reopening the tab

#### Issue-tracker links in the description column (jj-idea-91qf)

- [ ] In Settings → Version Control → Issue Navigation, add a pattern (e.g. issue regexp
      `[A-Z]+-\d+`, link `https://example.com/browse/$0`); Apply
- [ ] A commit whose description contains a matching reference (e.g. `Fixes JIRA-123`) shows it
      link-colored (not underlined at rest) in the log table's description column
- [ ] Hovering just the reference shows a hand cursor and underlines only that word, not the rest
      of the description; hovering elsewhere in the description shows the default cursor
- [ ] Left-clicking the reference opens the URL in your default browser
- [ ] Right-clicking the reference shows a popup with a single "Open <url>" action that does the same
- [ ] The row tooltip's description also renders the reference as a link
- [ ] With no Issue Navigation patterns configured, the description column renders exactly as
      before (no link, no hover cue)
- [ ] Narrowing the column so the description truncates still linkifies a reference that appears
      before the truncation point; one that would appear after it is dropped along with the rest
      of the truncated text, not left half-rendered

#### Description word spacing and copy fidelity (jj-idea-myje / GitHub #77)

- [ ] Describe a change with a long, multi-word description (long enough to wrap in the
      description column and in the commit details panel/tooltip) — it wraps at word
      boundaries like ordinary text, not only at the column edge
- [ ] Select some of that description's text with the mouse (in the description column, the
      details panel, or the row tooltip), copy it, and paste into a plain text editor — the
      pasted text has ordinary spaces between words, matching what you typed (not literal
      non-breaking spaces, which look identical on screen but paste/diff/search differently)
- [ ] Right-click the row → Copy Description (or the equivalent toolbar/keyboard action) still
      copies the description exactly as typed

#### Issue-tracker links inside bookmark/tag chip names (jj-idea-vrmv)

- [ ] With an Issue Navigation pattern configured (as above), create/rename a bookmark to include a
      matching reference (e.g. `jira-123-fix-thing`, regexp `[A-Za-z]+-\d+`) — the reference renders
      link-colored within the chip; the rest of the chip (icon, remaining text) stays plain
- [ ] Hovering just the reference substring shows a hand cursor and underlines only it; hovering the
      rest of the same chip (icon or non-matching text) shows no hand cursor, matching plain
      bookmark/tag chip hover (jj-idea-wkcz)
- [ ] Left-clicking the reference substring opens the URL in your default browser; left-clicking
      elsewhere in the chip does nothing (still no whole-chip left-click action)
- [ ] Right-clicking the reference substring shows a popup with a single "Open <url>" action;
      right-clicking elsewhere in the same chip still shows the usual bookmark/tag actions menu
      (Rename…, Delete, Forget, etc.) — the two right-click behaviors are position-sensitive
- [ ] Repeat for a tag name containing a matching reference
- [ ] A bookmark/tag name with no matching reference renders unaffected
- [ ] With no Issue Navigation patterns configured, chip names render exactly as before

#### Row click actions: author/committer links and bookmark/tag chips (jj-idea-iesq, jj-idea-wkcz, jj-idea-a52h)

Log rows render bookmark/tag chips and author/committer names with link styling. Author/committer
names are real left-click hyperlinks (left-click performs the default action; right-click opens a
menu with that default action pre-highlighted). Bookmark/tag chips are **not** — they have no
left-click action; only the right-click menu reaches their actions (jj-idea-wkcz, a prerequisite
for letting issue-tracker references *inside* a bookmark/tag name become their own links, without
a link-inside-a-link). Hovering one instead shows a subtle grey background highlight
(jj-idea-a52h) — the same "hover" tint used for a hovered row elsewhere — signaling "right-click
here" without a hand cursor implying a left-click action that doesn't exist.

- [ ] Author/committer names are link-colored at rest, with **no underline**; hovering the name adds an underline, and moving off it removes the underline again (jj-idea-iesq: was permanently underlined before)
- [ ] Hovering blank cell space to the right of a short author/committer name does **not** add an underline (matches the existing "no click target" boundary)
- [ ] Hovering an author name (not blank space in the cell) shows a hand cursor
- [ ] **Left-clicking** an author name opens the OS mail client addressed to that author's email
- [ ] **Right-clicking** an author name opens a menu with **Send Email to ...** highlighted, a separator, then **Filter Log by ...**
- [ ] Choosing **Filter Log by ...** narrows the log to that author (the Author filter chip updates) and closes the menu; choosing it again while already active clears the filter and closes the menu
- [ ] **Filter Log by ...** shows a checkmark when that author is the currently active author filter, and no checkmark otherwise
- [ ] **Left-clicking** a committer name opens the OS mail client (same as author)
- [ ] **Right-clicking** a committer name shows only **Send Email to ...** — no filter option
- [ ] Clicking blank cell space to the right of a short author/committer name does **not** launch the mail client
- [ ] Hovering a bookmark or tag chip does **not** show a hand cursor, but does show a subtle grey background highlight (jj-idea-a52h) — its accent color (bookmark/tag color) stays visible on top of the highlight. Check across the whole width of the chip (left edge, middle, right edge), not just one spot
- [ ] The highlight covers only the hovered chip's own icon+label(+suffix) — not the space before/after it, and not a neighboring chip
- [ ] **Left-clicking** a bookmark/tag chip does nothing — no filter change, no navigation
- [ ] **Right-clicking** a bookmark/tag chip opens a menu with **Filter Log to '...'** highlighted at the top, followed by a separator and the existing rename/delete/forget/move/advance/track actions (see MT-BOOKMARK for Advance)
- [ ] Choosing **Filter Log to '...'** from the right-click menu applies the filter and closes the menu; choosing it again while already active clears the filter and closes the menu
- [ ] **Filter Log to '...'** shows a checkmark when that reference is the currently active filter, and no checkmark otherwise — reopen the menu after toggling to confirm the checkmark follows the filter state
- [ ] The "+N more" overflow chip shows both a hand cursor and the same grey background highlight on hover (jj-idea-ttmp), and **left-clicking** it still opens its popup of hidden refs, each still openable via their own submenu
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7 (GitHub #107): `jj new` off a bookmarked change without moving the bookmark —
      the resulting unbookmarked head's log row shows a small slashed-bookmark marker after its
      (absent) bookmark chips; `jj bookmark set <name> -r <that change>` removes the marker after
      the auto-refresh; a change with a bookmark, or one that's merely an ancestor of one, never
      shows it (see MT-BOOKMARK's "Unbookmarked heads" for the bookmarks-panel side)
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7: the marker survives column-width capping (`cappedDecorations`) — narrow the
      graph+description column so bookmark/tag chips collapse into "+N more"; the dangling-head
      marker still renders after the overflow chip, uncollapsed, same as the `@` marker

#### Drag and drop - core infrastructure (jj-idea-6jvh)

This bead shipped the drag-and-drop *infrastructure* (payload/target model, y-aware zone hit-test,
guards, indicator painting). jj-idea-8fxs (see the next subsection) wired the first real drop
handler — commit-onto-commit rebase — so gestures other than that one still uniformly reject.

- [ ] Pressing and dragging from a commit row starts a drag gesture (the cursor changes to a
      drag/reject or drop cursor as appropriate); releasing over an unwired operation (e.g. a
      copy-modifier drag, or dropping a commit on a bookmark chip) does **not** change the log or
      repository state
- [ ] Dragging near the bottom edge of a long log (more rows than fit the viewport) auto-scrolls
      the table as the pointer approaches the edge (`SmoothAutoScroller`)
- [ ] Regression: with drag-and-drop installed, single-click select, Shift+click range,
      Ctrl/Cmd+click multi-select, double-click (Show Diff), right-click context menu (row and ref
      chip), and author/committer hover-link behavior are all unaffected
- [ ] Pressing on a row and dragging over *other* rows does not change the table's selection
      highlight to whatever row the pointer is currently over - the selection stays exactly what
      it was when the drag started, for the whole gesture (regression: a plain `JTable` without
      `dragEnabled` extends its selection to the row under the pointer on every drag tick, which
      visually fought the drop-zone indicator until this was suppressed)

#### Palette readability (jj-idea-mn1a)

- [ ] Switch the IDE to a **light** theme (e.g. IntelliJ Light). Bookmark chips, tag chips, the
      `@` working-copy marker, a conflicted change's marker, and a divergent change's marker are
      all comfortably readable against the row background — none reads as washed-out or
      near-invisible (was reported for bookmark gold, GitHub #51)
- [ ] Repeat with a row **selected** (chips keep their accent color per the hover-highlight item
      above; confirm it's still readable against the selection background too)
- [ ] Switch back to a **dark** theme (e.g. Darcula) and confirm nothing regressed there

### MT-LOG-GRAPH

**Graph rendering**

**Code:** `ui/log/JujutsuCommitGraph.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuGraphAndDescriptionRenderer.kt`, `ui/log/graph/DataStructures.kt`, `ui/log/graph/LayoutCalculator.kt`

- [ ] Graph lines render correctly for linear history, merges, and branches; the working
      copy (@) indicator is visible; colors differentiate branches; the graph column
      auto-sizes to content
- [ ] On a commit with ~30 bookmarks (e.g. `for i in $(seq 1 30); do jj bookmark create
      bm-$i; done`), the log row still shows description text (not blank), and the
      bookmarks collapse behind a "+N more" chip rather than overflowing the cell
      (jj-idea-w61m); the chip still shows a colored bookmark icon (not plain grey text),
      so the row still reads as a branch head even fully collapsed (jj-idea-lm3o); the icon
      is the tracked-bookmark glyph as long as every hidden bookmark is tracked (all local
      bookmarks count as tracked), and falls back to the plain glyph if any hidden bookmark
      is an untracked remote; on a commit whose overflow is tags only (no bookmarks
      hidden), the chip's icon is the green tag glyph instead
- [ ] Stress-test repo, many concurrent branches (`jj-idea-1ojh`, `jj-idea-5i6i`): run
      FX-STRESS; set Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → Log Limit to 200 so several
      branches fall out of view; apply an author or date filter to shrink the visible set
      further; confirm tree lines never cross over unrelated commits or share a lane; a
      commit whose parent is beyond the log limit (not loaded at all) shows a **faded
      straight line** down from its circle instead of a real connector, while a commit
      whose parent is loaded but hidden by the active filter shows a **wiggly line**
      instead (jj-idea-xi58 - the two are now visually distinct; a true nearest-visible-
      ancestor connector for the filtered case is still tracked separately as
      `jj-idea-hlu3`, not a bug here); a merge with one loaded parent and one
      unresolved parent shows its real connector plus a stub in its own lane, not just
      the real connector (jj-idea-1pgy); clear the filter and confirm the graph restores
      immediately without a manual Refresh
- [ ] Hovering that row's tooltip lists every bookmark, including the ones collapsed
      behind "+N more" (jj-idea-w61m), wrapping the bookmark list across multiple lines
      and showing the full description without being clipped by the screen edge; if the
      content is taller than the screen it scrolls instead of clipping (jj-idea-szn8)
- [ ] Left-clicking the "+N more" chip opens a popup listing the hidden bookmarks, each
      as a sub-menu with the usual bookmark actions (Rename…, Delete, Forget, etc.); right-
      clicking it does the same (jj-idea-w61m); with a large hidden count (~50+, e.g. via
      FX-STRESS), every sub-menu's actions are enabled/clickable as normal, not greyed out
      (jj-idea-lm3o); each sub-menu is labelled with the same colored bookmark
      (tracked/plain) or tag glyph its own chip would show

#### Long-edge navigation (jj-idea-sc8m)

Reuse FX-STRESS with `SCALE=6 WITH_REMOTE=1` and the paged log flag on, per MT-LOG-REFRESH's
"Paged log loading" fixture below.

- [ ] Hovering a long line whose child (upper) end is visible always points **down**, toward
      the invisible parent; hovering one whose parent (lower) end is visible always points
      **up**, toward the invisible child — direction never depends on where within the row
      you point, only on which end is actually off-screen
- [ ] When *both* ends are off-screen (e.g. scrolled to the middle of a very long branch),
      direction instead depends on which half of the **viewport** the row falls in: rows in
      the top half point up, rows in the bottom half point down. Moving the mouse gradually
      from one visible row to the next changes direction **at most once**, at a single
      stable transition row near the viewport's middle — not back and forth per row, and
      not depending on where within a row you point
- [ ] Whichever direction is active thickens the side of the line that *is* the navigation
      target and shows a directional resize cursor (↑/↓); the side that isn't the target
      stays plain/normal weight (not a dimmed or translucent overlay) — the tooltip names
      the target commit and how many rows up/down it is
- [ ] When one end is visible, the thickened treatment runs the **entire** way to that end's
      own commit circle, with no gap or thin segment beforehand - including where the
      connector is a diagonal (e.g. into/out of a merge commit), not just a plain vertical
- [ ] Scroll the log (mouse wheel, scrollbar, keyboard) while hovering a long edge without
      moving the mouse: the thickened span/direction updates to match the new viewport
      immediately, instead of staying stuck at the position from before you scrolled
- [ ] No stray extra vertical segments appear anywhere else in the graph while hovering - a
      merge with 3+ parents is the sharpest test: hover each of its connector lines
      individually and confirm nothing appears in an unrelated lane, and that the thickened
      treatment stops exactly at a visible end's circle rather than bleeding into whatever
      unrelated edge happens to reuse that lane immediately below/above it
- [ ] Hovering a **faded straight stub** (a `NOT_LOADED` unresolved parent) shows a
      directional-down cursor and a "Parent not loaded yet — click to load" tooltip
      (a stub has no child-ward direction to offer, so it's always "down"); clicking it
      loads and scrolls to reveal that parent, exactly as if you had scrolled to trigger
      the load
- [ ] Apply a filter that hides an ancestor so its row shows the **wiggly line**
      (`HIDDEN`, jj-idea-xi58) — hovering it shows a tooltip naming what's hidden but the
      cursor stays the plain arrow (not a directional cursor), and clicking it does nothing
      (clearing the filter is the only way to reveal it, per jj-idea-hlu3)
- [ ] A short edge whose both ends are already on screen gets no hover treatment at all —
      the graph looks exactly as it did before this feature
- [ ] Double-clicking a long edge navigates the same way a single click does, instead of
      also triggering the row's Enter-bound action (e.g. Show Diff)
- [ ] Confirm the graph column's text indent (where the description starts) looks
      unchanged from before this change, on both a linear history and a wide multi-branch
      view

#### Graph layout under filtering (jj-idea-7jkr)

→ automate: jj-idea-2k2b (layout re-alignment under filtering is a deterministic
`LayoutCalculator` computation, testable without rendering)

Reuse FX-STRESS rather than building another throwaway multi-branch repo — it already has far
more lanes than the 3-4 needed here.

- [ ] Type a text filter that hides some rows — the graph re-draws to match the **visible** rows only: lines do not extend to hidden commits, no misaligned passthrough lines across the remaining rows
- [ ] Clear the text filter — the graph returns to the full layout immediately (no stale passthrough lines from the filtered view)
- [ ] Apply author, date, or root filter on a multi-branch repo — same check: graph lines align with visible rows only
- [ ] Rapid typing (several characters quickly) converges to a single correct layout within ~250 ms (no flickering per keystroke)

### MT-LOG-DETAILS

**Commit details panel**

**Code:** `ui/log/JujutsuCommitDetailsPanel.kt`, `ui/components/HtmlTextCanvas.kt`, `ui/components/TextCanvas.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuLogContextMenuActions.kt`, `ui/log/LogClickTarget.kt`, `actions/filechange/FileChangeActionGroup.kt`
**Also re-run:** MT-DIFF-PREVIEW (details changes panel shares the preview-tab behavior); MT-LOG-TABLE (change-id link click handling and the file-change context menu are shared with the log table / working copy panel)

- [ ] Details panel shows on row selection
- [ ] Metadata displays correctly (author, date, change ID)
- [ ] Author line shows `Name <email>` as a single clickable mailto link; when the committer
      differs from the author, a "committed by Name <email>" line also appears with its own mailto link
- [ ] Narrow the details panel (or use a commit with a long name/email, e.g. a bot commit) so the
      author/committer line must wrap: `Name <email>` and `· date, time` each wrap as a whole (never
      splitting mid-email or mid-date), with a visible gap between them, never touching
- [ ] Description renders HTML formatting
- [ ] Splitter position persists
- [ ] Toggle details panel position (right/bottom) works
- [ ] On a commit with several long/hyphenated bookmarks (e.g. `hotfix/issue-123`,
      `feature/long-name-here`), narrow the panel until the bookmark line wraps — each
      bookmark (icon + name) stays intact on one line; wrapping only occurs between
      bookmarks, never inside a name or between its icon and text (jj-idea-kds1)
- [ ] The `Name <email>` link is link-colored, with **no underline** at rest; hovering it adds
      an underline, moving off removes it (jj-idea-iesq)
- [ ] Hovering a bookmark or tag chip in the details panel shows a subtle grey background
      highlight but no hand cursor (jj-idea-a52h) — check across the whole chip width including
      near its right edge, a hit-testing bug meant this used to only hold over roughly the left half
- [ ] **Left-clicking** a bookmark/tag chip does nothing here either; **right-clicking** opens the
      same menu as the log table (Filter Log to '...' plus rename/delete/forget/move/track), with
      the checkmark reflecting active filter state
- [ ] **Right-clicking** an author or committer email in the details panel opens the same menu as
      the log table (Send Email to ..., plus Filter Log by ... for the author) — this previously
      did nothing at all (jj-idea-a52h)
- [ ] **Right-clicking** a parent/change-id link (e.g. a parent reference in a merge commit's
      details) opens that commit's full log-row context menu (Show Diff, New/Edit, Describe,
      Abandon, Rebase, etc.) — this previously showed an empty "Nothing Here" placeholder
      (jj-idea-in2h). Left-click still navigates/selects that commit as before
- [ ] Right-click a change-id link whose target has since become invalid (e.g. abandon that
      commit via the CLI in another terminal, then right-click the now-stale link without
      refreshing) — shows an empty menu rather than throwing or crashing
- [ ] jj-idea-g2p8 (GitHub #84): right-click one or more files in the changed-files list of a
      **historical** commit's details panel → **Restore to This** opens the Restore dialog
      (see MT-WORKINGCOPY's "Restore dialog" for the full checklist) listing the files that
      differ between that commit and `@`, with the right-clicked file(s) pre-checked;
      confirming restores exactly the checked files via `jj restore -f <that revision>`

#### Issue-tracker links in descriptions (jj-idea-10fo)

- [ ] In Settings → Version Control → Issue Navigation, add a pattern (e.g. issue regexp
      `[A-Z]+-\d+`, link `https://example.com/browse/$0`); Apply
- [ ] Select a commit whose description contains a matching reference (e.g. `Fixes JIRA-123`) —
      the reference renders underlined/link-styled in the details panel
- [ ] Clicking the reference opens the URL in your default browser
- [ ] A bare `https://…` URL in a description is also clickable and opens correctly
- [ ] A commit description with no matching reference renders unchanged (plain text, no link)

#### Issue-tracker links inside bookmark/tag chip names (jj-idea-vrmv)

- [ ] With an Issue Navigation pattern configured (as above), select a commit with a bookmark/tag
      whose name contains a matching reference (e.g. `jira-123-fix-thing`) — the reference renders
      link-colored within the chip in the details panel's bookmark/tag line; the rest of the chip
      (icon, remaining text) stays plain
- [ ] Hovering just the reference substring shows a hand cursor and underlines only it; hovering the
      rest of the same chip (icon or non-matching text) shows no hand cursor and no background
      highlight — the two hover cues don't overlap
- [ ] Left-clicking the reference substring opens the URL in your default browser; left-clicking
      elsewhere in the chip still does nothing
- [ ] Right-clicking the reference substring shows a popup with a single "Open <url>" action;
      right-clicking elsewhere in the same chip still shows the usual bookmark/tag actions menu
- [ ] A bookmark/tag name with no matching reference in the details panel renders and right-clicks
      exactly as before (ref-only hover highlight, no link)
- [ ] With no Issue Navigation patterns configured, descriptions render exactly as before

#### Details Changes Panel

- [ ] File change tree shows correct files
- [ ] Preview-tab behavior (double-click, Enter, tab-swap, Escape, Cmd/Ctrl+D, F4): see MT-DIFF-PREVIEW
- [ ] Open file for historical version opens correct version
- [ ] Open file for working copy opens editable editor
- [ ] jj-idea-lo7u: right-clicking a file for a historical commit shows "Compare Before with
      Another Commit..."; hidden for the working-copy entry and for a root commit
- [ ] Right-click a file in the details panel's change tree → **Show History** appears in the
      menu (jj-idea-cb3r, fixed for real in jj-idea-v9g4 — the initial jj-idea-cb3r fix added it to
      the menu-building code but the action stayed invisible there since it only read
      `CommonDataKeys.VIRTUAL_FILE`, which this tree only supplies for a working-copy selection —
      see `JujutsuChangesTree.showsLocalFiles`) and opens that file's custom history tab, same as
      from the editor's Jujutsu submenu
- [ ] Repeat from the **Working Copy** tool window's file tree and from a compare-changes panel
      (e.g. "Compare with Another Commit…") — **Show History** works from all of them, not just
      the commit details panel
- [ ] Right-click a **deleted** file (e.g. in a historical commit's file list) → **Show History**
      is still available (uses the file's last-known path, not just files with current content)
- [ ] Multi-select several files in the details panel's change tree for a **historical** commit
      (not `@`) → **Show History** is disabled/hidden rather than silently acting on just one of
      the selected files

#### Platform file actions on the changes tree (`JujutsuChangesTree.showsLocalFiles`)

- [ ] Select `@` (the working copy) in the log → in the details panel's change tree, select one
      or more files → the IDE's **Reformat Code** (Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+L) and **Optimize Imports**
      (Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+O) both act on the selected file(s) on disk
- [ ] Right-click a file in that same `@`-selection tree → Jujutsu submenu → **Annotate** opens
      the gutter annotations for that file
- [ ] F4 on that same `@`-selection still opens the file via **Jujutsu.OpenChangeFile** (unchanged
      — this tree owns the F4 shortcut, not the platform's generic Jump to Source)
- [ ] Select a **historical** (non-`@`) commit in the log → in the details panel's change tree,
      Reformat Code/Optimize Imports/Annotate either do nothing or act on the *editor's* current
      file (not silently acting on the historical revision or the working-copy file instead)
- [ ] "Open File" on a historical commit's change still opens that **revision's** content, not
      the current working-copy file, both before and after selecting files in the tree

### MT-LOG-FILTER

**Toolbar, filters, and reference filter**

**Code:** `ui/log/JujutsuFilterComponent.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuAuthorFilterComponent.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuDateFilterComponent.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuReferenceFilterComponent.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuRootFilterComponent.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuPathsFilterComponent.kt`, `ui/log/LogFilterMatcher.kt`, `ui/common/FilterPriorityLayoutStrategy.kt`, `ui/common/CommitTablePanel.kt`, `ui/log/UnifiedJujutsuLogPanel.kt` (primaryActions), `actions/change/DescribeChangeAction.kt`, `actions/change/RebaseChangeAction.kt`

#### Toolbar & filters

- [ ] Refresh button reloads data; text search filters in real-time; regex and
      case-sensitivity toggles both work
- [ ] Author dropdown shows all authors and restricts visible entries when applied;
      bookmark/reference and date filters each restrict correctly
- [ ] Clear filters (X button) resets all filters; multiple active filters combine correctly (AND logic)

#### Search by Git commit hash (jj-idea-odzo)

→ automate: jj-idea-4u7j (hash-prefix matching, filter AND-combination, and regex/case
toggles are pure `LogFilterMatcher` logic, testable without rendering)

- [ ] Copy a full 40-character Git commit hash of a commit currently visible in the log
      (e.g. `jj log -T commit_id`) and paste it into the search field — the row filters
      in and is the only result
- [ ] Paste just an abbreviated prefix of that hash — it still matches
- [ ] Paste the hash in a different case (e.g. uppercase) — it still matches (case-insensitive
      by default)
- [ ] Paste a hash for a commit that isn't currently loaded in the log window and press **Enter**
      — see "Whole-repo search on Enter (jj-idea-lpbv)" below

#### Whole-repo search on Enter (jj-idea-lpbv)

**Code:** `jj/LogSearchRevset.kt`, `ui/log/UnifiedJujutsuLogDataLoader.kt` (`searchWholeRepo`,
`fetchSearchResults`), `ui/log/UnifiedJujutsuLogPanel.kt` (`onSearchSubmitted`),
`ui/common/CommitTablePanel.kt` (status bar), `ui/log/LogFilterMatcher.kt` (full-body matching)

→ automate: `jj-idea-lpbv`'s own unit tests already cover revset construction
(`LogSearchRevsetTest`) and per-repo fetch/merge logic (`UnifiedJujutsuLogDataLoaderTest`); this
section is for the end-to-end wiring that only shows up when jj actually runs.

Setup: lower "Number of changes to show" (Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu) to something
small (e.g. 100) against `scripts/fixtures/fx-stress.sh`'s ~1084-commit repo (`jj-stress-test`,
shared with MT-LOG-GRAPH/MT-LOG-FILTER's other stress fixtures) so most commits are off-window.

- [ ] Find a commit hash/change-id well past the window (e.g. `jj log -r 'all()' -T commit_id
      --no-graph --limit 2000`), paste it into the search field — typing alone shows no results;
      pressing **Enter** fetches and shows it as the only visible row, and the status bar reports
      it was found outside the current view
- [ ] Type a word that appears only in an off-window commit's description **body** (not its first
      line) — Enter finds it (full-body matching, not just the summary line)
- [ ] Type gibberish that matches nothing — Enter leaves the table unchanged and the status bar
      says no changes were found
- [ ] Type free text containing punctuation (e.g. `fix: the . thing`) — Enter must not error (check
      `idea.log`); it just searches description/author as usual
- [ ] Click **Refresh** — the merged-in search results disappear and the log returns to the
      configured revset/limit
- [ ] In a multi-repo project, repeat with a hash from a second repo — results from both roots
      merge and the root gutter stays correct
- [ ] Open a file's history (right-click a file → Show History) — Enter in its search field
      behaves exactly as before (whole-repo search is log-window only, not wired to file history)

#### New/Edit toolbar buttons (jj-idea-e53e)

- [ ] **New** and **Edit** icon buttons appear at the left of the main log toolbar, before Refresh, each with a tooltip
- [ ] Selecting a mutable non-working-copy change and clicking **Edit** moves the working copy to it (it becomes `@`) and the log reselects it
- [ ] Selecting the working-copy change or an immutable commit disables **Edit**
- [ ] **Edit** has a default keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E, jj-idea-crt0) — check Settings → Keymap for "Jujutsu.EditChange"; with a log row selected, pressing it edits that row. (This shortcut soft-conflicts with IntelliJ's built-in "Recent Locations" outside the log table — Recent Locations still wins there since Edit is disabled without a log selection; a keymap conflict warning in Settings → Keymap is expected, not a bug)
- [ ] Clicking **New** with a change selected creates a new empty change on top of the selection and it becomes `@`; with no selection it stacks on the working copy
- [ ] Clearing the log selection entirely (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd-click the selected row to deselect) disables **New** (greyed out) rather than removing it from the toolbar — it stays in place, matching **Edit**'s behavior
- [ ] Open a file's history (right-click a file > Show History) — confirm its toolbar shows only Refresh/search, with no New/Edit buttons

#### Rebase/Describe toolbar buttons (jj-idea-ck64, GitHub #78)

- [ ] **Rebase** and **Describe** icon buttons appear on the main log toolbar, after **Edit** and before Refresh, each with a tooltip and a default keyboard shortcut (check Settings → Keymap for "Jujutsu.RebaseChangeToolbar" / "Jujutsu.DescribeChangeToolbar")
- [ ] Selecting a mutable change and clicking **Describe** opens the same description dialog as the right-click menu's Describe entry; editing and confirming updates the change
- [ ] Selecting an immutable change disables **Describe**; selecting nothing also disables it (stays in place, greyed out)
- [ ] Selecting one or more mutable changes (same repo) and clicking **Rebase** opens the same rebase dialog as the right-click menu's Rebase entry, pre-populated with the selection as source
- [ ] Multi-selecting changes across two repos in a multi-root project disables **Rebase** (no arbitrary repo is picked), matching **New Change From These**'s cross-repo behavior
- [ ] Selecting only immutable changes disables **Rebase**
- [ ] Pressing the toolbar buttons' keyboard shortcuts while the log table has focus triggers the same actions as clicking them

#### Context-menu shortcut hints (jj-idea-crt0)

- [ ] Right-click a log row → the **Rebase** and **Describe** entries show their keyboard shortcut hint next to the label (e.g. "Ctrl+Shift+R"), matching the toolbar buttons — this previously showed no hint even though the toolbar shortcut existed
- [ ] Right-click a change-id link (e.g. a parent reference in the commit details panel) → its menu's **Rebase**/**Describe** entries do **not** show a shortcut hint (this menu acts on the link's target, not the table's live selection, so it deliberately keeps using a non-registered action) and that menu has no **New**/**Edit** entries at all
- [ ] Multi-select several mutable rows (same repo), right-click → **Rebase** is enabled and opens with all of them as source; multi-select spanning two repos → **Rebase** is disabled
- [ ] Multi-select several rows, right-click → **Describe** is disabled (only meaningful for a single selection)
- [ ] Open a file's history (right-click a file > Show History) — confirm its toolbar still shows only Refresh/search, with no Rebase/Describe buttons

#### Narrow-width toolbar (jj-idea-kxx4)

- [ ] Shrink the log tool window / splitter narrower and narrower — New, Edit, Refresh,
  Fetch, **Push**, Columns, and Details-position buttons all stay visible and clickable at
  every width; they are never pushed off-screen
- [ ] As the window narrows, the search field shrinks down to a minimum width and stops
  (it does not keep shrinking to zero or overlap the buttons)
- [ ] As the window narrows further, filter chips (Reference, Author, Date, Root) start
  disappearing from the toolbar one at a time and a "»" overflow chevron appears in their
  place; clicking the chevron opens a popup listing all filters, including the ones that
  no longer fit — from there they're fully usable (clicking one opens its dropdown)
- [ ] With no filters applied, narrowing hides filters in trailing (rightmost) order first
- [ ] Apply a value to a filter that would otherwise be hidden first (e.g. select a bookmark
  in the Reference filter, then narrow) — the applied filter stays visible and unapplied
  filters are hidden ahead of it, even though the applied filter isn't the leftmost one;
  whatever remains visible keeps its original left-to-right order (nothing reorders/jumps)
- [ ] Widen the window back out — hidden filters reappear and the chevron disappears once
  everything fits again

#### Reference filter (bookmark/tag dropdown)

Use a repo where the log limit is **smaller** than total history, with at least one bookmark and
one tag pointing at commits **beyond** the limit. FX-STRESS at Log Limit 100 works: `main`,
`release-1.0`/`release-2.0`, and the `v1.0` tag all sit deep in history, and `main`'s ancestry
is immutable.

- [ ] Dropdown lists **all** local bookmarks (with the gold bookmark icon, narrower than the tag icon), not only those on loaded log rows, including bookmarks beyond the log limit
- [ ] Dropdown lists **all** tags (with the green tag icon), including tags beyond the log limit
- [ ] Bookmark and tag icons are visibly distinct from each other and from the "@" working-copy icon, and colored to match the bookmark/tag colors used in the log table

#### Loading placeholder (jj-idea-a52h)

- [ ] Open the dropdown as early as possible after opening the project/log tab (before bookmarks/tags have had time to load) — it shows a single disabled "Loading bookmarks and tags…" entry instead of looking empty
- [ ] Reopen the dropdown once bookmarks/tags have loaded — the placeholder is gone, replaced by the real list
- [ ] For a repo that genuinely has no bookmarks or tags, the dropdown eventually shows as empty (no bookmark/tag rows, no "@" if there's no working copy either) once loading finishes — it does **not** get stuck on the loading placeholder forever

#### Remote-only bookmarks (jj-idea-iadu)

Clone a repo and leave at least one remote bookmark **untracked** (e.g. `jj git clone`, then
push a bookmark from another clone without running `jj bookmark track` in this one —
`jj bookmark list --all-remotes` in the terminal should show it as untracked).

- [ ] Dropdown lists the untracked remote bookmark as `name@remote`, with an icon visibly
      distinct from local bookmarks (plain vs. filled bookmark icon)
- [ ] A local bookmark whose remote is synced (tracked, same target) appears only **once**, as
      the plain local name — no duplicate `name@remote` row
- [ ] Selecting the remote-only bookmark filters the log to that commit and its ancestors,
      expanding the log window first if the target is outside the current limit
- [ ] The currently-selected reference shows a checkmark next to its icon; no other row does
- [ ] Hovering over rows or moving the keyboard selection up/down does **not** move the checkmark — it stays on the actually-selected reference
- [ ] Creating/deleting a bookmark or tag in the terminal updates the dropdown after the auto-refresh (see MT-LOG-REFRESH) — without clicking Refresh or saving a file
- [ ] Selecting a reference that **is** on a loaded row filters the log to that commit and its ancestors, and the dropdown closes
- [ ] Selecting a reference whose target is **outside** the log limit expands the log to a context window around that commit, then applies the ancestor filter (no silent empty result)
- [ ] Selecting "@" (working copy) filters to the working copy and its ancestors
- [ ] Reopening the dropdown while a filter is active scrolls to and highlights the currently-selected reference
- [ ] Arrow up/down moves the highlight; Enter applies the highlighted reference and closes the dropdown
- [ ] Clearing the filter restores the full (limited) log

#### Multi-repo scoping (jj-idea-1ra9, jj-idea-2xf3)

Open a multi-root project with at least two independent (non-colocated) jj repos — FX-STRESS
alongside one other repo works.

- [ ] Filtering to a bookmark that exists in only one repo shows **only** that repo's ancestry —
      no other repo's root commit ("zzzzzzzz", "no description", empty) appears
- [ ] The graph draws **no** connector line between rows from different repos, even though every
      repo's root shares the same underlying change id
- [ ] Filtering to "@" (working copy) shows **every** repo's working copy, each with its own
      ancestry — not just the first repo's

### MT-LOG-REFRESH

**Auto-refresh**

**Code:** `ui/log/UnifiedJujutsuLogDataLoader.kt`, `ui/common/BackgroundDataLoader.kt`

- [ ] Log refreshes when files change in working copy
- [ ] Log refreshes after VCS operations (describe, new, edit)
- [ ] Log refreshes after an **external** jj operation run in a terminal (e.g. `jj new`,
      `jj bookmark create`) within ~300 ms, without saving a file (op-heads watch) — this is the
      canonical auto-refresh check; other sections (bookmark widget, reference filter) reference
      it rather than repeating it
- [ ] Working copy (@) selection maintained after refresh
- [ ] No flickering during refresh
- [ ] jj-idea-c4tp: open a large repo's log, click Refresh, then close the project while it is
      still loading → project closes promptly (no multi-minute stall); idea.log shows the load
      being cancelled rather than running to completion

**Manual refresh (jj-idea-bbn3, GitHub #115)**

**Code:** `ui/common/CommitTablePanel.kt` (`manualRefresh`), `jj/JujutsuStateModel.kt`
(`invalidateRepositoryState`)

Under normal conditions this bug is invisible: the op_heads VFS watch (previous section)
fires on essentially every jj operation and refreshes bookmarks/working-copy state before
you'd ever click Refresh, masking the difference between `manualRefresh()` and the old
`forceRefresh()`-only behavior. To exercise the fix, first kill the watch the reporter's
network-drive repo effectively has dead: launch the sandbox IDE with
`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Didea.filewatcher.disabled=true ./gradlew runIde` (disables IntelliJ's
native file watcher process — same failure mode, no `.jj/repo/op_heads` events ever
delivered).

- [ ] With the watcher disabled, run `jj bookmark create refresh-check` (or delete/move an
      existing bookmark) in a terminal, and **don't refocus the IDE window** (frame-activation
      refresh is a separate fallback path that would mask this too) — confirm the bookmark
      chip, reference filter dropdown, and status-bar widget stay stale
- [ ] Click toolbar **Refresh** — confirm all three now update
- [ ] To confirm this bullet actually exercises the fix (rather than passing vacuously),
      temporarily revert `manualRefresh()` to call only `dataLoader.forceRefresh()`, rebuild,
      and re-run the same steps — Refresh should now reload log rows but leave the bookmark
      stale; then restore the fix

#### Paged log loading (jj-idea-2c8k, GitHub #69, early access)

**Code:** `ui/log/PagedLogWindow.kt`, `ui/log/UnifiedJujutsuLogDataLoader.kt`,
`ui/common/CommitTablePanel.kt`, `ui/log/graph/LayoutCalculator.kt`

See docs/design/jj-idea-2c8k-paged-log-loading.md for the mechanism and its validated (and
not-yet-validated) boundaries. Enable via Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → Log →
"Load log in pages (early access)". Use FX-STRESS's `SCALE=6 WITH_REMOTE=1` fixture
(`jj-stress-test`, ~5,952 commits) for a repo large enough that the difference from the
non-paged behavior is perceptible.

- [ ] With the flag **on**, open the log: loads fast, showing the first page (page size = the
      "Changes to show" setting); the status strip below the table stays hidden the whole time
      (no "Showing N changes" message in this mode — the scrollbar already says there's more)
- [ ] On a wide multi-branch repo (e.g. FX-STRESS), rows whose parent didn't make it into any
      loaded page show a **faded straight line** down from the commit circle instead of nothing
      (which would look like a true root) — distinct from the wiggle used for the filtering case
      above (jj-idea-xi58: a paged-window boundary isn't elision, it just hasn't loaded yet)
- [ ] Clicking that faded straight line loads and reveals the missing parent, scrolling to it
      once it arrives — see MT-LOG-GRAPH's "Long-edge navigation" (jj-idea-sc8m) subsection for
      the full hover/click behavior
- [ ] Scroll to the bottom of the loaded rows: more history loads in automatically before you
      reach the literal end (eager one-page-ahead prefetch); scrolling repeatedly keeps loading
      further pages at a consistent, flat pace — not slowing down page over page; the viewport
      stays where you scrolled to (does not jump back up to the selected/`@` row) each time a new
      page loads
- [ ] Right-click → **New Change** (or **Describe**, **Squash**, **Abandon**): appears/updates
      at the top effectively immediately, regardless of how many pages you've scrolled through
- [ ] jj-idea-wrza: scroll several pages deep, then run a write that adds a commit at the top
      (`jj new` in a terminal, or the right-click actions above) — the rows under the viewport
      stay put (no slide by a row) even though a commit was spliced in far above them. Repeat
      scrolled to the very top: the new commit appears at row 0 and is visible, rather than the
      viewport holding its old pixel position and hiding it
- [ ] After scrolling several pages deep, perform a write near `@`: still fast, and the
      previously-scrolled-to deeper pages remain visible/unaffected
- [ ] Perform a write whose effect lands on a commit deep in history you haven't scrolled to
      (e.g. move a bookmark via a picker to an off-screen commit): it's still found/selected
      correctly (falls back to the existing loadContext/GitHub #76 mechanism), even though
      slower than the common case
- [ ] After scrolling several pages deep, click toolbar **Refresh**: confirm the scroll depth /
      total loaded row count is preserved (not collapsed back to one page), and total time is
      proportional to pages loaded, not instant (deliberate — Explicit Refresh re-verifies
      everything currently loaded, it doesn't just reload page 1)
- [ ] Toggle the flag **off**: behavior reverts to today's full-reload shape (confirms the flag
      actually gates the new code path), including the status strip reappearing with the old
      "Showing N of limit — change the limit in Settings" message once the log is truncated
- [ ] Click a bookmark/reference filter entry that's currently off-screen (explicit navigation,
      not a data refresh): the viewport still scrolls to make it visible, unlike the loadMore
      case above — confirms the scroll-suppression fix didn't break real navigation
- [ ] Raise "Changes to show" to a large value (e.g. 5,000) with the flag on: the *first* page
      load and each subsequent scroll-triggered page cost what a fetch of that size costs, but a
      write near `@` stays fast (post-write refresh only ever touches page 1, independent of
      page size)

### MT-CTXMENU

**Log row context menu actions**

**Code:** `actions/change/`, `ui/duplicate/DuplicateDialog.kt`, `ui/duplicate/DuplicateImmutabilityGuard.kt`, `ui/newchange/NewChangeDialog.kt`, `ui/rebase/RebasePreviewPanel.kt`, `ui/rebase/RebaseSimulator.kt`, `ui/common/JujutsuCompareChangesPanel.kt`, `ui/components/RevisionSelectorPopup.kt`, `actions/change/compareWithRevisionAction.kt`
**Also re-run:** MT-SQUASH, MT-SPLIT (share the commit picker); MT-DIFF (Compare with Working Copy / Show Diff in New Tab reuse the RevisionSelectorPopup and Changes-pane view); MT-WORKINGCOPY (its "New Change" button shares `CommandExecutor.new`)

- [ ] Right-click opens context menu
- [ ] **Copy Change ID** works and copies to clipboard
- [ ] **Copy Description** works and copies to clipboard
- [ ] **New Change From This** (primary, no dialog) creates new change directly and refreshes
- [ ] **New Change...** (secondary) opens the New Change dialog and creates the change
- [ ] **Edit** action changes working copy
- [ ] **Describe** action opens dialog and updates description
- [ ] jj-idea-n3w1 (GitHub #46): the Describe dialog opens with the description field already
      focused; it's a real commit-message editor (spellcheck, subject-length inspection, Ctrl+E
      history popup), not a plain text box; Enter inserts a newline, Ctrl+Enter accepts
- [ ] jj-idea-is97 (GitHub #76 regression): the Describe dialog's prompt reads "Enter description
      for change \<short-id\>:" using the same short id shown in the log row, not the full
      64-character change id
- [ ] **Abandon** action removes change after confirmation
- [ ] **Duplicate Change** action creates an identical copy in place, with a new change ID and the same description; `@` does not move
- [ ] **Duplicate Onto...** opens a dialog to pick a destination and placement (onto/after/before), then creates the copy there
- [ ] jj-idea-2md7: hovering a commit row in the Duplicate Onto... destination picker, and in the
      Rebase destination picker / preview, shows real bookmark/tag chips and status icons in the
      tooltip - not a broken-image glyph
- [ ] jj-idea-rskx: **Set Tag Here...** shows a distinct tag-plus badge icon (not the platform's
      generic + icon); entering a name creates the tag at that commit and the log updates

#### Undo (jj-idea-v9zp)

**Code:** `ui/services/UndoBalloon.kt`, `ui/services/JujutsuUndoService.kt`,
`actions/undo/UndoLastOperationAction.kt`, `actions/change/abandonChangeAction.kt`,
`ui/restore/RestoreDialog.kt` (jj-idea-g2p8)

Stage 1 of the undo roadmap (docs/design/undo-support-roadmap.md). Wired to **Abandon**,
**Duplicate Onto**, **Move Bookmark**, **Rebase** (drag-and-drop), **Set Tag**, and now
**Restore**/**Restore to This** (jj-idea-g2p8) - the rest of jj-idea-t0iy's rollout is still
pending, see the last bullet below.

- [ ] Create a change, `jj new`, then **edit a file so the working copy is dirty** before
      abandoning (exercises the snapshot-op exclusion) → right-click → **Abandon** → confirm
- [ ] The change disappears **and** a Jujutsu balloon appears with an inline **Undo** link
- [ ] Click **Undo** → the change reappears, working-copy files refresh, the balloon expires
- [ ] Repeat with a **clean** working copy (no snapshot op written) — identical behavior
- [ ] Abandon again, **dismiss the balloon without clicking Undo**, then open the **VCS**
      main-menu → an entry reads **"Undo Abandon"**; invoking it brings the change back
- [ ] Invoke **"Undo Abandon"** a second time (nothing left to undo) → the entry is now
      disabled, reading "Undo Last Jujutsu Operation" (visible, not hidden - hover shows why)
- [ ] While a balloon is still showing, run `jj new` in a terminal in the same repo, *then*
      click the balloon's Undo link → it undoes the abandon specifically, not the terminal
      command
- [ ] In a terminal, `jj op log` shows a **new** "revert" operation was added (the log grew),
      not that an earlier operation was removed
- [ ] Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → JJ executable path → point at a pinned older jj
      (`scripts/jj-install-version.sh 0.37.0`, then `~/.local/bin/jj-0.37`) → repeat the first
      three checks above — confirms the mechanism works at `JjVersion.MINIMUM`
- [ ] Push, fetch, squash, split, describe, resolve, file track/untrack, and config actions
      all behave exactly as before this change, and **none** of them show an undo balloon
      yet (jj-idea-t0iy extends this to the rest)
- [ ] Settings → Keymap → search "Jujutsu" → **Undo Last Jujutsu Operation** shows that name,
      not the raw action id `Jujutsu.UndoLastOperation`
- [ ] jj-idea-g2p8: modify a file, right-click → **Restore**, tick it in the dialog, confirm
      → a balloon appears reading "Restore" with an inline **Undo** link; clicking it brings
      the discarded content back and refreshes the working-copy tree
- [ ] jj-idea-g2p8: same check for **Restore to This** from a historical commit's changed
      files (see MT-LOG-DETAILS) → the balloon reads "Restore to This"

#### Duplicate Change (jj-idea-vu35)

- [ ] Right-clicking an **immutable** change still offers both Duplicate actions (unlike Abandon/Describe/Edit)
- [ ] Multi-selecting several changes (same repo) and choosing **Duplicate Change** creates an identical copy of each, in place
- [ ] Multi-selecting commits across two repos in a multi-root project: both Duplicate actions are disabled/hidden
- [ ] **Duplicate Onto...**: choosing "Onto (-d)" places the copy as a child of the destination
- [ ] **Duplicate Onto...**: choosing "Insert after (-A)" / "Insert before (-B)" places the copy relative to the destination accordingly
- [ ] **Duplicate Onto...** with no destination selected shows a validation error and does not close the dialog

#### Duplicate Onto... immutability guard (jj-idea-70e6)

In a repo with an immutable trunk (e.g. `main` tracked as immutable, with mutable commits on top):

- [ ] Selecting an immutable **head** (no children) as destination: "Insert after" stays enabled; "Insert before" greys out
- [ ] Selecting an immutable **non-head** commit (has a child) as destination: both "Insert after" and "Insert before" grey out; only "Onto" is selectable
- [ ] With "Insert before" already selected, immutable commits don't appear in the destination picker at all
- [ ] With "Insert after" already selected, only immutable commits that have an immutable child are hidden from the picker; an immutable head remains selectable
- [ ] Switching placement back to "Onto" makes every commit (including immutable ones) reappear in the picker
- [ ] A permitted "Insert after" on an immutable head actually succeeds when you click Duplicate
- [ ] Normal "Onto" duplicates and the quick in-place **Duplicate Change** action are unaffected by the guard

#### Dialog commit-picker ordering (jj-idea-6fxz, jj-idea-45id)

→ automate: jj-idea-pa05 (cold-cache ordering is a `logCache`/`RepoLogCache` invariant,
testable without rendering)

Restart the IDE (or open a repo the log tool window hasn't loaded yet) so `logCache` starts cold for it, then — **without** opening the main log tab for that repo first — open a dialog with a commit picker (Rebase, Squash Into..., Duplicate Onto..., Move Bookmark to Change):

- [ ] The picker's commit order matches what the main log window shows (newest first, root/oldest last) — not reversed or arbitrary
- [ ] The graph connector lines in the picker render correctly (no crossed/backwards lines), consistent with a cold-cache fetch
- [ ] Opening the main log tab afterwards shows the same order as the dialog did

In a **multi-repo** project (multiple `.jj` roots open together):

- [ ] Open the main log tab (loads and merges all repos), then open a commit picker for each repo in turn — every repo shows its own commits newest-first, root last; none show the root (or any commit) out of place
- [ ] Repeat across a few IDE restarts — the correct ordering should hold consistently for every repo, not just some of them

#### Dialog commit-picker search (jj-idea-tq4b)

**Code:** `ui/components/LogSearchField.kt`, `ui/components/CommitPickerPanel.kt`,
`jj/LogSearchRevset.kt`, `ui/log/LogFilterMatcher.kt`, `ui/rebase/RebaseDialog.kt`,
`ui/duplicate/DuplicateDialog.kt`, `ui/squash/SquashIntoDialog.kt`,
`actions/bookmark/MoveBookmarkToChangeDialog.kt`

→ automate: `CommitPickerPanelTest` covers predicate/search combination, selection
preservation, and the one-`jj log`-call-per-Enter contract without rendering a dialog; this
section is for the toggles' visible behavior and the end-to-end off-window search in each
dialog.

- [ ] Open **Rebase**, **Squash Into…**, and **Duplicate Onto…** on a mutable commit — each
      destination picker's search field now shows regex/match-case/whole-words toggle icons,
      matching the main log window's search field
- [ ] In each, toggling **regex** and typing a pattern (e.g. `fix.*bug`) filters the picker by
      regex instead of literal text; toggling **match case** makes the filter case-sensitive;
      toggling **whole words** restricts matches to whole-word boundaries
- [ ] In each, typing part of a bookmark name filters to commits carrying that bookmark (this is
      new — previously only Rebase/Squash Into…/Duplicate Onto… matched bookmark names by plain
      substring, and Move Bookmark to Change didn't match them at all)
- [ ] **Squash Into…**'s **parent mode** (right-click → Squash Into Parent) still shows its small
      fixed candidate list with **no** search field — unaffected by this change

Setup for the off-window checks below: lower "Number of changes to show" (Settings → Version
Control → Jujutsu) to something small (e.g. 100) against a repo with several hundred commits
(e.g. `scripts/fixtures/fx-stress.sh`'s `jj-stress-test` fixture, shared with MT-LOG-FILTER's
whole-repo-search section) so most commits are off-window. Find a change ID well past the
window (e.g. `jj log -r 'all()' -T change_id --no-graph --limit 2000`).

- [ ] **Rebase**: paste the off-window change ID into the destination search — typing alone
      shows no rows; pressing **Enter** fetches and shows it as a selectable destination, and a
      status line below the table reports it was found; selecting it and clicking Rebase succeeds
- [ ] **Squash Into…** (both picking a destination and picking sources) and **Duplicate Onto…**:
      repeat the same paste-then-Enter check; the found commit is selectable and the operation
      completes
- [ ] **Move Bookmark to Change**: paste the off-window change ID, press Enter — it appears under
      the correct Forward/Backward section (matches the classification the initially-loaded rows
      use) and moving the bookmark to it succeeds
- [ ] In **Rebase**/**Duplicate Onto…**, search for a change ID that both matches nothing loaded
      *and* would be invalid as a destination for the current source (e.g. a descendant) — Enter
      still finds it via the whole-repo query, but selecting it and confirming shows jj's own
      rejection rather than silently succeeding (this is the documented ancestry-completeness
      limitation, not a crash)
- [ ] Typing gibberish that matches nothing and pressing Enter leaves the picker unchanged and the
      status line reports no results, in every dialog above
- [ ] Closing a dialog mid-search (e.g. click Cancel immediately after pressing Enter, before the
      result would normally appear) does not throw in `idea.log` and does not reopen/flash the
      dialog

#### New Change quick action (jj-idea-byfa)

- [ ] With the log focused and a commit selected, pressing Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N creates a new change on top of it, with no dialog, and the log reselects the new change
- [ ] With the log focused and nothing selected but the default working-copy (@) selection, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N creates a new change on top of @
- [ ] With the **editor** focused (not the log), Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N still triggers the IDE's normal Go to File / New Scratch File action - it is not intercepted
- [ ] Multi-selecting two commits (same repo) and choosing **New Change From These** (or the shortcut) creates a merge change with both as parents
- [ ] Multi-selecting commits across two repos in a multi-root project: **New Change From This/These** is disabled/hidden (no arbitrary repo is picked)

#### New Change... dialog (jj-idea-grc8, GitHub #83)

Build a small stack `A → B → C` (three plain changes) for this section.

- [ ] Right-click B → **New Change...** opens a dialog showing B as the target, an empty
      description field, placement radios (Onto/Insert after/Insert before, Onto selected by
      default), a "Switch working copy to the new change" checkbox (checked), and a live preview
      graph
- [ ] **Onto** + typing a description + Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter): creates a plain child of B with
      that description, `@` moves to it — matching the old "New Change with Description..."
      flow's effect. (jj-idea-n3w1, GitHub #46: the description field became a real
      commit-message editor, so plain Enter now inserts a newline instead of submitting — verify
      this is in fact the current behavior, since it's a change from the plain text area this
      dialog used before)
- [ ] **Insert after**: preview shows the new change between B and C; clicking Create makes it
      so — C is rebased onto the new change, `@` moves to it, log reselects it
- [ ] **Insert before**: preview shows the new change between A and B; clicking Create makes it
      so — B (and C) are rebased onto the new change, `@` moves to it
- [ ] Unchecking "Switch working copy to the new change" before clicking Create: the change is
      inserted but `@` stays on its prior commit (`jj new --no-edit`)
- [ ] Preview fidelity: for each placement mode, the graph shown before clicking Create matches
      what the log shows immediately after
- [ ] Multi-selecting B and another head, then **Insert after**: creates a merge change with both
      as parents and relocates both targets' children onto it
- [ ] Right-clicking an **immutable** change and choosing New Change...: **Insert before** is
      disabled (would rewrite the immutable target); **Insert after** stays enabled unless the
      target has an immutable child, matching the Duplicate Onto... immutability guard above
- [ ] Cross-repo multi-select in a multi-root project: the action is disabled/hidden (no arbitrary
      repo is picked), same as **New Change From This/These**
- [ ] Right-clicking a `jjc://` change-navigation link (e.g. a parent reference in the commit
      details panel) still offers **New Change...** and it acts on the link's target

#### Move Up / Move Down (jj-idea-owje, GitHub #93)

Move Up/Down swap the selected commit with its single child/single parent **in the commit
graph** — not whatever row happens to be adjacent on screen. Build a small stack
`A → B → C → D` (four plain changes, `A` immutable - e.g. `jj config set --repo user.email a;
jj new; jj new; jj new` then `jj bookmark create -r A base` and set the diff base / advance
`main`/trunk over `A` so it becomes immutable) for the linear checks below, plus a small merge
(`A → B`, `A → C`, `B,C → D`) for the branch/merge checks.

- [ ] On the linear stack, select `B` or `C` and press Ctrl+Shift+Up (same on macOS - Cmd+Shift+Up
      is deliberately **not** bound, see the plugin.xml comment on `Jujutsu.MoveChangeUp`) — it
      swaps with its single child, the log reselects it in its new position, and `jj log` in a
      terminal confirms the parent/child order now matches the table
- [ ] Press it again — the commit keeps climbing one position per press
- [ ] Ctrl+Shift+Down: moves the same commit back down
- [ ] The undo balloon after a move reads "Move" (not "Rebase"); **Undo** restores the previous order
- [ ] Select `D` (no child) — Move Up is disabled; select `A` (no parent) — Move Down is disabled
- [ ] Select `B` (single parent immutable `A`) — Move Down (which would `jj rebase -r B -B A`,
      rewriting the immutable commit) is disabled; Move Up remains enabled
- [ ] Multi-select two rows — both Move Up and Move Down are disabled
- [ ] Right-click a row: **Move Up**/**Move Down** appear near **Rebase...** in the context menu,
      each showing its keyboard-shortcut hint
- [ ] Focus the **editor** (not the log) and press Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down — the editor's own "Move
      Statement Up/Down" still fires; it is not intercepted
- [ ] On **macOS**, in the Commit/Local Changes file list, press Cmd+Shift+Up/Down — it still
      extends the selection to include every change above/below (the platform's own
      `EditorTextStartWithSelection`/`EditorTextEndWithSelection`, unaffected since Move Up/Down
      is deliberately not bound to Cmd+Shift+Up/Down on macOS)
- [ ] On the merge shape, select `A` (two children `B`/`C`) — Move Up is disabled (ambiguous
      which child to swap with); select `D` (two parents) — Move Down is disabled
- [ ] Select `B` (single child `D`, single parent `A`) — both directions enabled and each swap
      lands where the graph predicts, confirmed via `jj log`
- [ ] In a multi-root project, arrange two repos' commits so one repo's row displays directly
      above/below a commit from the *other* repo (any timestamps that interleave will do) —
      moving the first repo's commit must act on its own repo's child/parent (or disable if it
      has none), never touch the adjacent row from the other repo
- [ ] Apply a log filter that hides the selected commit's actual single child while leaving an
      unrelated commit visually adjacent — Move Up still targets the real (hidden) child, not
      the visible neighbour

#### Compare with Working Copy (jj-idea-a6cz, jj-idea-vtdl)

- [ ] Right-clicking a non-working-copy commit shows **Compare with Working Copy**
- [ ] Right-clicking the working-copy entry: **Compare with Working Copy** is **not visible**
- [ ] Invoking it on a commit with differences from `@` opens the **VcsChanges** tool window with a Changes tree listing every changed file (added/modified/deleted/renamed all included), and the first file's diff open in the editor
- [ ] Selecting other files in the tree updates the diff in the same reusable editor tab
- [ ] The right (working-copy) side of the diff is editable, and edits are written through to the real file on disk
- [ ] The left (commit) side is read-only
- [ ] Right-clicking a file in the Changes tree shows the jj file-change context menu (Show Diff, Restore, etc.)
- [ ] Invoking it on a commit identical to `@` shows a "No Differences" notification instead of an empty pane

#### Compare with Another Commit / Compare Before with Another Commit (jj-idea-jp33)

- [ ] Right-clicking any historical commit shows **Compare with Working Copy**, **Compare with
      Another Commit...**, and **Compare Before with Another Commit...** together, in that order
- [ ] Right-clicking the **working-copy** entry: **Compare with Working Copy** is not visible, but
      **Compare with Another Commit...** is still shown and enabled
- [ ] Right-clicking a **root commit** (no parents): **Compare Before with Another Commit...** is disabled
- [ ] Invoking **Compare with Another Commit...** opens the same revision-picker popup as
      **Compare with Branch...** (bookmark/change ID/revision search); picking one opens a
      Changes-pane tab titled `<selected> vs <picked>`, with the **selected commit's content on
      the left** and the **picked revision's content on the right**, both read-only
- [ ] Invoking **Compare Before with Another Commit...** on a commit compares its **parent** (not
      itself) against the picked revision, same left/right convention; on a **merge commit** the
      left side reflects the auto-merged parent content (matching Compare with Working Copy's
      merge-parent handling)
- [ ] Picking a revision identical in content to the base shows a "No Differences" notification, no tab opens
- [ ] Typing an unresolvable revision in the picker shows a "Compare Failed" error dialog
- [ ] Both actions also appear, and work identically, from a `jjc://` change-navigation link's menu

#### Show Diff in New Tab, multi-file (jj-idea-vtdl)

- [ ] Multi-selecting files (in the log's file list or a commit's changes) and choosing **Show Diff in New Tab** opens the same VcsChanges Changes-pane view as Compare with Working Copy, with the first file's diff open
- [ ] Selecting a single file still shows a title with just that file's name; multiple files show "N files"

### MT-SQUASH

**Squash Into…**

**Code:** `ui/squash/SquashIntoDialog.kt`, `ui/squash/SquashFilePreview.kt`, `ui/common/FileDiffPreviewPanel.kt`, `ui/common/HunkPickPreviewController.kt`, `ui/common/HunkSelectionModel.kt`, `diffedit/HunkPickerDialog.kt`, `diffedit/HunkArrowDiffExtension.kt`, `diffedit/DiffEditTool.kt`, `actions/change/squashIntoAction.kt`, `actions/change/squashFromAction.kt`, `actions/filechange/SquashIntoFilesAction.kt`
**Fixture:** FX-STACK
**Also re-run:** MT-CTXMENU (shares the commit picker); MT-SPLIT (shares `ui/common/FileDiffPreviewPanel.kt`, `ui/common/HunkPickPreviewController.kt`, the hunk picker, and the staging protocol); MT-DIFF, MT-DIFF-PREVIEW (the hunk picker registers a plugin-wide `diff.DiffExtension` — confirm it stays a no-op on every other diff viewer)

#### Availability / enablement

- [ ] "Squash Into..." is present in context menu for a single mutable change
- [ ] "Squash Into..." is present when 2+ mutable changes are selected
- [ ] "Squash Into..." is **disabled** when any selected change is immutable
- [ ] "Squash Into..." is **disabled** when selections span multiple repos (multi-root project)
- [ ] "Squash into Parent..." still works for single-parent mutable changes (regression)

#### Destination picker

- [ ] Dialog opens with source change(s) listed at the top
- [ ] Source change itself is **not** selectable as destination
- [ ] Immutable changes are **not** shown in the destination table
- [ ] **Descendants of the source ARE shown** as valid destinations (e.g. selecting "change A", "change B" and "change C" should both appear)
- [ ] Typing in the search field filters by change ID, description, and bookmark name
- [ ] Clearing the search restores the full filtered list
- [ ] Selecting a destination populates the description field (if user hasn't typed)
- [ ] jj-idea-2md7: hovering a commit row with bookmarks/tags in the picker table shows real chip
      icons in the tooltip - not a broken-image glyph

→ automate: jj-idea-ikr6 (description auto-population + validation logic below is pure
string/state logic, no rendering dependency)

#### Description editor (jj-idea-n3w1, GitHub #46)

The description field is now a real commit-message editor (`ui/components/DescriptionEditor.kt`,
wrapping the platform's `CommitMessage`) instead of a plain text area:

- [ ] Typing a long first line shows the subject-length inspection highlight; misspelling a word
      shows a spellcheck squiggle
- [ ] The toolbar's history button (Ctrl+E / Cmd+E) opens a popup of recently-used descriptions
      from other dialogs/changes; picking one previews it, Escape reverts, and it doesn't close
      the dialog
- [ ] Enter inserts a newline (does not submit/click OK); Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter) submits

#### Per-file diff preview (jj-idea-8a8z)

The preview always shows **Before** (the source's own pre-change content, fixed) next to
**Destination** (that same content, plus this file's change if it's ticked — i.e. what the
destination ends up with). This is deliberately anchored to the source's own before/after,
not the real destination's content — see the section's linked issue for why.

- [ ] Right-click a mutable change with 2+ changed files → **Squash into Parent…** (or
      **Squash from Here into…**) → a preview pane appears to the right of the file list,
      wider dialog overall
- [ ] Click a file → preview shows a syntax-highlighted, read-only diff titled roughly
      "Before" / "Destination (all changes)", showing the file's full change (all files are
      ticked by default, so everything moves)
- [ ] Untick that file → titles flip to "Destination (unchanged)" and the diff goes empty;
      re-tick → restored
- [ ] Click a second file → preview switches to it; click back to the first → switches back
      immediately (no visible reload)
- [ ] **Squash Into Here from…** (multi-source picker): select a file, then change the
      source selection in the picker table → preview resets to the placeholder and the file
      tree repopulates
- [ ] Multi-select two changes → **Squash Into…** → preview works on the combined file list
- [ ] Select a binary or deleted file → preview degrades gracefully (no exception)

#### Hunk picking (jj-idea-4q7m)

Single-source only — jj's diff editor is one before/after pair, so hunk-level squashing across
multiple sources isn't well-defined. Reuses Split's 3-pane arrow picker
(`diffedit/HunkPickerDialog.kt`) with squash-specific wording: Before (fixed) | destination
(live) | full source change (fixed) — a right-hand arrow squashes a hunk into the destination, a
left-hand arrow reverts it back to unsquashed. No "resolved" concept, so no merge-conflict
confirmation dialogs.

- [ ] Right-click a mutable change with 2+ changed files → **Squash into Parent…** → select a
      changed file → **Pick Hunks…** button is enabled below the preview
- [ ] **Squash Into…**/**Squash Into Here from…** with **two or more sources selected** →
      **Pick Hunks…** is **not offered** (hidden); selecting down to exactly one source makes it
      appear
- [ ] Click **Pick Hunks…** → a 3-pane diff opens: Before | destination (live) | full source
      change, with arrows at each hunk's divider
- [ ] Move one hunk's arrow so only part of the file's change is squashed → **Apply** → dialog
      closes with **no confirmation dialog of any kind**
- [ ] The file now shows **half-checked** in the file list; the diff preview title reads
      "Destination (partial)"
- [ ] **The file's tick state is unchanged by a partial pick** — re-open the file list and
      confirm the checkbox itself wasn't force-ticked or unticked
- [ ] Reopen **Pick Hunks…** on that file → the middle pane resumes the exact prior partial
      selection
- [ ] Click **Apply** with every hunk moved to the destination side → file **fully ticks**;
      with every hunk left unsquashed → file **fully unticks**; either way the override clears
      (reopening the picker starts fresh from the tick-derived default, not a stale partial)
- [ ] With a partial pick present, the **"Delete empty source and move working copy"** checkbox
      is disabled (a partial squash can never empty the source) and the description field shows
      only the destination's own description (no merge)
- [ ] Click **Squash** → `jj diff` on the destination shows only the picked hunk; the source
      still has the rest of that file's change
- [ ] Repeat with a change that **deletes a file**: tick the deletion (or pick-hunks to fully
      squash it) alongside a partial pick elsewhere → the deletion lands in the destination too
      (not left behind as an empty file)
- [ ] Open any ordinary diff elsewhere in the IDE → no gutter arrows appear (the `DiffExtension`
      stays a no-op outside the picker)
- [ ] **Split regression pass** (the preview cache and hunk picker are now shared with Split):
      run MT-SPLIT's "Basic hunk selection" and "Hunk picking with the 3-pane arrow picker"
      checks — wording must read "Parent"/"Child", not the squash wording above

#### Description auto-population (full squash — all files selected)

- [ ] Field pre-fills correctly for each source/dest description combination: both non-empty
      (`<dest desc>\n\n<source desc>`), dest empty (source only), source empty (dest only),
      both empty (empty); multi-source appends all non-empty source descriptions after dest
- [ ] Editing the description field prevents further auto-updates on destination change

#### Description auto-population (partial squash — some files unchecked)

- [ ] Field shows **only the destination description**, regardless of what the source description is
- [ ] Switching back to all-files-selected restores the combined pre-fill (if user hasn't edited)

#### Validation

- [ ] "Squash" button is active initially (if destination pre-selected after load)
- [ ] Clicking "Squash" with no destination selected shows inline error "Select a destination"
- [ ] Unchecking all files in the tree shows inline error "Select at least one file"

#### "Delete empty source and move working copy" checkbox

- [ ] Checkbox is **enabled** when all files are selected (full squash)
- [ ] Checkbox is **disabled** (grayed out) when any file is unchecked (partial squash — source won't be empty)
- [ ] Checkbox defaults to unchecked
- [ ] Last-used state is remembered across dialog opens

**Full squash, checkbox unchecked (default):**
1. Select "change A" → "Squash Into..." → pick "change B", leave all files
2. Leave checkbox unchecked → click "Squash"
- [ ] "change A" is kept (now empty) — it was NOT abandoned
- [ ] Working copy stays where it was (@ does not move to B)
- [ ] Log selection stays on "change A"

**Full squash, checkbox checked:**
1. Select "change A" → "Squash Into..." → pick "change B", leave all files
2. **Check** the checkbox → click "Squash"
- [ ] "change A" disappears (abandoned)
- [ ] "change B" now contains `a.txt`
- [ ] If "change A" was the working copy (@), working copy moves to "change B"

**Partial squash, checkbox disabled:**
1. Add two files: `jj new -m "multi" && echo "x" > x.txt && echo "y" > y.txt`
2. Select that change → "Squash Into..." → pick any destination
3. Uncheck `y.txt` in the file tree
- [ ] Checkbox is grayed out and cannot be checked
4. Click "Squash"
- [ ] Only `x.txt` moves to the destination
- [ ] Source change still exists (now containing only `y.txt`)
- [ ] Source description is unchanged (no `--message` sent)
- [ ] Destination description is unchanged

#### Squashing a parent into a child (descendant target)

1. Select "change A" → "Squash Into..." → pick "change C" as destination
- [ ] "change C" appears in the destination picker
2. Leave all files selected → click "Squash" (checkbox unchecked)
- [ ] Squash completes without error
- [ ] "change A"'s content is now in "change C"

#### Multi-source squash

1. Ctrl/Cmd+click to select "change A" and "change B" → "Squash Into..."
2. File tree shows files from both A and B combined
3. Pick "change C" as destination → click "Squash"
- [ ] Both A and B disappear from log (or are kept if checkbox unchecked — check either way)
- [ ] "change C" now contains files from both A and B

#### Working copy as source

1. Make sure `@` is on "change C" with some content
2. Select `@` → "Squash Into..." → pick "change B" as destination

**Without checkbox:**
3. Leave checkbox unchecked → click "Squash"
- [ ] Working copy stays on "change C" (now empty or partial)
- [ ] "change B" has the squashed content

**With checkbox:**
3. Check the checkbox → click "Squash"
- [ ] "change C" (old @) is abandoned
- [ ] Working copy moves to "change B" (now @)
- [ ] No stranded empty change left behind

#### Merge commit target

1. Create a merge: `jj new -m "merge" change_a change_b`
2. Select the merge commit → "Squash Into..."
- [ ] Merge commit appears as a valid destination in the picker
- [ ] Squashing into the merge commit succeeds

### MT-SPLIT

**Split, hunk-level selection**

**Code:** `ui/split/SplitDialog.kt`, `ui/common/HunkSelectionModel.kt`, `ui/common/HunkPickPreviewController.kt`, `ui/common/FileDiffPreviewPanel.kt`, `diffedit/HunkPickerDialog.kt`, `diffedit/HunkArrowDiffExtension.kt`, `diffedit/DiffEditTool.kt`, `actions/change/splitAction.kt`, `actions/filechange/SplitFilesAction.kt` (also `SplitIntoNewParentFilesAction`)
**Also re-run:** MT-CTXMENU (shares the commit picker in some flows); MT-DIFF, MT-DIFF-PREVIEW (the hunk picker registers a plugin-wide `diff.DiffExtension` — confirm it stays a no-op on every other diff viewer); MT-SQUASH (shares `ui/common/FileDiffPreviewPanel.kt`, `ui/common/HunkPickPreviewController.kt`, the hunk picker, and the staging protocol)

Setup: create a scratch jj repo with a file that has at least **two separate** hunks of changes
(so partial selection is meaningful).

Model (jj-idea-8khi, GitHub #101 UX follow-up — identity-first wording, shared by every mode):
**ticking a file moves it to a brand-new commit**; unticked files **stay on the source's own
change ID and position**. Nothing is ticked by default. Only the new commit's *position* varies
with mode: a child (default), a sibling (`--parallel`), or a parent (`-B`/"Split into New
Parent"). "Pick Hunks…" opens a native **3-pane** diff — Before (fixed) | Stays (live) | New
commit (fixed) — with a directional arrow at each hunk's divider instead of a checkbox: a right
arrow at a Before|Stays divider moves that hunk to the new commit; a left arrow at a
Stays|New-commit divider moves it back. The Stays pane genuinely updates in place as you click,
so you always see the actual resulting content, not just an inferred state — this replaced an
earlier 2-pane checkbox picker (itself replacing the original 3-way *merge* widget) specifically
so gnarlier, many-hunk splits have somewhere to see the live result while picking. The Stays pane
is view-only (arrow clicks only, no direct typing) — deliberately, so the result is always a
well-formed composition of Before/New-commit hunks. No "resolved" concept, so no merge-conflict
confirmation dialogs anywhere in this picker.

#### Basic hunk selection (main dialog preview)
- [ ] Right-click a mutable change → **Split…** → dialog shows changed-files list on the left (nothing ticked) and a native read-only diff preview on the right
- [ ] Under "Source", a muted note states the mode's shape: default mode reads "The existing commit (&lt;shortid&gt;) keeps its change ID and position; ticked files move to a new child commit created on top of it."
- [ ] The note **word-wraps across multiple lines** and does **not** widen the left column or push the diff preview panel narrower — the splitter stays at its usual ~40/60 proportion regardless of note length (jj-idea-8khi follow-up: a plain, non-wrapping label here previously forced the column wide enough to fit the whole sentence on one line)
- [ ] The change id embedded in the note and in both description labels renders with the same bold-prefix/grey-remainder styling used everywhere else in the plugin (log table, commit details, other dialogs' "Source" line) — not plain, equal-weight text
- [ ] Click a file in the list → right panel shows a native syntax-highlighted diff titled **"Existing commit (all changes)"** / **"New commit (no changes)"** — "Existing commit"/"New commit" are the same consistent noun pair used everywhere in this dialog: the summary line, the hunk picker, and (via "Description for existing commit …"/"Description for new commit …") the description labels below (jj-idea-8khi follow-up: previously the preview/summary/hunk-picker used the bare word "Here" while the description label separately said "(keeps change ID)" — two different, mismatched names for the same side) — with an **empty diff** (nothing ticked yet, so nothing moves)
- [ ] Tick the file → titles switch to **"…(no changes)"** / **"…(all changes)"** (the "no changes"/"all changes" pair flips sides — never "(unchanged)", which would wrongly imply the stays-side is literally the file's unmodified parent), showing the **full diff** (the whole file's change moves to the new commit); untick → back to the first pair and empty diff
- [ ] Fully-ticked files show a filled checkbox; unticked show empty; partially-picked (see below) show a **half-checked** box
- [ ] Directory nodes containing a partial file also show a half-checked box

#### Right-click file(s) → "Split into New Child"
- [ ] Select one or more files in the working-copy / commit-details file list, right-click → **Split into New Child** → dialog opens with exactly those files **ticked** (moving to the child)
- [ ] Split → the new child commit contains only the selected files; the parent keeps the rest

#### Right-click file(s) → "Split into New Parent" (jj-idea-qswq / jj-idea-tkog, GitHub #74)

Uses `jj split -B` (verified against jj 0.44: the ticked fileset becomes a **new** commit inserted
before the source; everything else **stays on the source's own change ID and location** — the
opposite polarity from "Split into New Child"'s plain `jj split`, where the ticked fileset becomes
a new **child** and the unticked fileset keeps the original ID). Unlike the original jj-idea-qswq
implementation (which just inverted the tick pre-selection through the same no-flag `jj split`),
the right-clicked files now tick **directly**, same as "Split into New Child".

- [ ] Select one or more files, right-click → **Split into New Parent…** appears alongside **Split into New Child…**
- [ ] Invoking it opens the dialog with exactly the selected files **ticked** — the same starting tick state as "Split into New Child", not inverted
- [ ] Dialog title reads "Split into New Parent"; the note under "Source" reads "The existing commit (&lt;shortid&gt;) keeps its change ID and position; ticked files move to a new commit inserted below it."; above the ticked description editor, the label reads **"Description for new commit (parent of &lt;shortid&gt;)"**, and above the unticked one, **"Description for existing commit (&lt;shortid&gt;)"** — the same identity-first wording as the other two modes, with only the parenthetical spelling out that this mode makes the new commit the *parent* (jj-idea-8khi: one combined label per editor, not a separate header plus sub-label)
- [ ] The **"Description for existing commit …"** block is on top, **"Description for new commit …"** below — the reverse of "Split into New Child"'s order (new-commit block on top, existing-commit block below) — matching each side's actual position in the log: the existing commit keeps the more-recent position, the new commit becomes the older parent one row further down
- [ ] The "Create parallel commits" checkbox is **not shown** (mutually exclusive with `-B`)
- [ ] "Pick Hunks…" is **not shown** (hunk-level partial selection isn't supported in this mode)
- [ ] Split → via `jj log`/`jj show`: the ticked files land in a **new commit inserted as the parent** of the original; the original commit (unticked files) keeps its **own original change ID**, now with the new commit as its parent
- [ ] Editing the new-commit description field and splitting → the new commit gets that description (passed as `-m`); the existing-commit field, if left unedited, leaves the original commit's description untouched
- [ ] Editing the existing-commit description field and splitting → after the split completes, the original commit's description updates to match (chained via a follow-up `jj describe` on the same, unchanged change ID)
- [ ] **Splitting the working copy itself**: an info line under the source commit reads "The working copy (@) stays on the existing commit (<shortid>); the new commit becomes its parent" — after splitting, confirm `@` is still genuinely on the original change ID (not the new parent)
- [ ] Compare: repeat "Split into New Child" on the working copy — its info line instead reads "The working copy (@) moves to the new commit", and after splitting `@` has genuinely moved
- [ ] Selecting **every** changed file → dialog opens with every file ticked, which trips the "at least one file must stay here" validation (nothing would be left at the original change ID) — expected, not a bug
- [ ] Selecting **no** files → ticking nothing trips "move at least one file to the new commit" — expected

#### Hunk picking with the 3-pane arrow picker
- [ ] Click **Pick Hunks…** → a dialog opens titled "Pick Hunks — <filename>" with **three** panes: Before | Existing commit (live) | Moves to New commit — "Existing commit"/"New commit" are the same identity-first labels as the main dialog (jj-idea-8khi), not literally "Parent"/"Child"
- [ ] On a freshly-opened **unticked** file: Existing commit's text equals the New-commit pane's; every hunk shows as a Before|Existing-commit divider bar with a **right arrow**
- [ ] Click a right arrow → that hunk's Existing-commit content flips to Before's text (matching); the Before|Existing-commit bar for that hunk disappears, and a **new** Existing-commit|New-commit bar with a **left arrow** appears in its place
- [ ] Click that left arrow → reverses back to a Before|Existing-commit bar with a right arrow — confirm this is reversible any number of times, either direction, independently per hunk
- [ ] **Try typing directly into the Existing-commit pane** → rejected; it's view-only, arrow clicks are the only way to change it (a deliberate choice, so the result is always a clean composition of Before/New-commit hunks, never a hand-edited hybrid)
- [ ] Click **Apply** with a mix of moved/unmoved hunks → dialog closes immediately with **no confirmation dialog of any kind** (the regression the original merge-widget picker had — a "Save changes and mark the conflict resolved anyway?" prompt used to fire here)
- [ ] After Apply → file shows **half-checked** in the file list; summary shows "(N partial)"
- [ ] **The file's tick state is unchanged by a partial pick** — if it was unticked before opening the picker, it's still unticked after a partial Apply
- [ ] Moving every hunk to the new commit → Apply results in a **fully ticked** file (no half-check), same as ticking it directly
- [ ] Moving no hunks (or reversing back to none) → Apply results in the file being **fully ticked or unticked** to match its starting state, with no partial override left over
- [ ] Click **Cancel** → closes immediately with **no confirmation dialog**; file state (tick + any prior override) unchanged
- [ ] **Reopen "Pick Hunks…" on a file with an existing partial selection** → the Existing-commit pane opens already showing the exact prior split (the content itself resumes; no per-hunk state to reconstruct)
- [ ] Split (linear) → new commit contains only the hunks left pointing at it; the existing commit has the rest
- [ ] Log refreshes selecting the newly created change
- [ ] **Global extension no-op check**: open any ordinary diff elsewhere (log → Show Diff, a working-copy file diff) — confirm **no arrows appear** and behavior is identical to before (the arrow overlay is registered as a plugin-wide `diff.DiffExtension`, gated to fire only inside this picker)

→ automate: jj-idea-ygtw (validation, whole-file fast path, and binary gating below are
state/routing logic, not rendering)

#### Descriptions
- [ ] Both description fields are pre-populated with the source commit's description
- [ ] Each editor has exactly **one** label above it — "Description for new commit (child of
      &lt;shortid&gt;)" / "Description for existing commit (&lt;shortid&gt;)" in the default mode
      — not two stacked lines (jj-idea-8khi follow-up: a separate bold identity header plus a
      near-duplicate plain sub-label like "New commit description" was noisy and repeated the
      same fact twice)
- [ ] "Existing commit" is the same name used for this side everywhere else in the dialog —
      preview pane title, summary line, hunk picker — not a different phrase like the earlier
      "(keeps change ID)", which read as a mismatched part of speech next to "New commit"
      (jj-idea-8khi follow-up)
- [ ] The label does **not** say anything like "(unchanged unless edited)" — considered and
      dropped: it's implementation detail (whether a follow-up `jj describe` runs) that doesn't
      change what to do, and the field's own pre-filled text already shows nothing will change
      unless you touch it
- [ ] New-commit description field appears **above** the existing-commit field (matching the new commit's position above the source in the log in the default, child mode)
- [ ] Editing the new-commit description field updates the new commit; editing the existing-commit field updates the source commit
- [ ] (jj-idea-n3w1, GitHub #46) Both fields are real commit-message editors, not plain text
      areas: typing a long subject line highlights it, misspellings get a spellcheck squiggle,
      and Enter inserts a newline rather than doing anything else

#### Parallel split (jj-idea-8khi, GitHub #101 UX follow-up)
- [ ] Check "Create parallel commits" → the ticked-side description label switches from
      "Description for new commit (child of &lt;shortid&gt;)" to "Description for new commit
      (sibling of &lt;shortid&gt;)"; the unticked-side label stays "Description for existing
      commit (&lt;shortid&gt;)" — unchanged, since that side's meaning never varies by mode
- [ ] The mode note under "Source" switches to "The existing commit (&lt;shortid&gt;) keeps its
      change ID and position; ticked files move to a new commit created beside it. Any existing
      children become merges of both." — confirm this happens **immediately** on toggling, not
      just after some other event
- [ ] With a file already selected in the preview, check "Create parallel commits" → the diff
      preview's pane titles ("Existing commit"/"New commit") and the summary line below the file
      tree relabel live too — wait, these two are already mode-invariant text, so nothing changes
      there; confirm instead that the **description labels**, the **mode note**, and the
      **working-copy note** (if splitting @) all update immediately, with no separate event
      needed to trigger the refresh (jj-idea-o6sw's original bug: toggling only updated internal
      label state, not the already-rendered preview/summary)
- [ ] In parallel mode, a fully-ticked file's preview still reads "Existing commit (no changes)" /
      "New commit (all changes)" — unaffected by the mode, since the preview always uses the
      same "Existing commit"/"New commit" pair, never "(unchanged)" (which would wrongly imply a
      parent relationship that doesn't exist between siblings)
- [ ] Uncheck "Create parallel commits" again → description labels, note, preview and summary all revert live
      to the child wording
- [ ] **With an existing child of the split target**: split it in parallel mode → via `jj log`,
      confirm the previously-existing child now has **two parents** (both new siblings) — it's
      become a merge (verified against real jj 0.44 in
      `MutatingCommandsContractCliTest`'s "split --parallel makes an existing child a merge of
      both new siblings" contract test)
- [ ] **Splitting the working copy itself in parallel mode**: the working-copy note (same text as
      the default mode's — "The working copy (@) moves to the new commit") is accurate here too;
      after splitting, confirm `@` is on the new **sibling**, not the side that kept the original
      change ID (verified in the same contract test file, "split --parallel on the working copy…")
- [ ] Split → two sibling commits created (not parent/child)

#### Validation
- [ ] With nothing ticked → OK is disabled with a message to move at least one file to the new commit — same message in every mode (default, parallel, and "Split into New Parent")
- [ ] With everything ticked (no overrides) → OK is disabled with a message that at least one file must stay here — same message in every mode
- [ ] With nothing ticked but one file partially picked via "Pick Hunks…" → OK is **enabled**; splitting produces a new commit with just those hunks (GitHub #117)

#### Whole-file fast path
- [ ] With no partial hunk selection (all files fully ticked or unticked) → split completes via file-level `jj split` (no diff-editor overhead); verify via log that both commits have the expected files

#### Binary / conflicted files
- [ ] A binary file in the changed list shows no "Pick Hunks…" button (whole-file only)

### MT-BOOKMARK

**Bookmark widget**

**Code:** `ui/toolbar/JujutsuBookmarkToolbarWidget.kt`, `ui/statusbar/JujutsuBookmarkStatusBarWidget.kt` + `JujutsuBookmarkStatusBarWidgetFactory.kt`, `actions/bookmark/BookmarkMenu.kt`, `actions/bookmark/`, `actions/bookmark/pushBookmarkAction.kt`, `jj/ClosestBookmarks.kt`, `jj/JjFeature.kt`, `ui/workingcopy/WorkingCopyControlsPanel.kt` (Advance Bookmark toolbar button)
**Also re-run:** MT-LOG-REFRESH (label reactivity relies on the same auto-refresh path); MT-CROSS (multi-repo dropdown structure); MT-WORKINGCOPY (Advance Bookmark toolbar button); MT-GIT (push confirmation dialogs triggered from this action); MT-LOG-FILTER (the bookmarks panel's "Filter Log to Bookmark" action); MT-LOG-TABLE (log tab layout — the bookmarks panel adds a splitter); MT-SETTINGS (new persisted per-window panel-visibility state)

As of jj-idea-cpno, the bookmark widget lives in the main IDE toolbar (next to where Git's
branch widget would sit), not the log window's filter row — this is the location fix for
GitHub #62. A status-bar fallback (MT-BOOKMARK-STATUSBAR below) takes over when the main
toolbar itself is hidden or unavailable.

#### Single-repo project

- [ ] "\<name\>" label appears in the **main IDE toolbar** (not the log toolbar) when @ has a local bookmark
- [ ] Settings → Keymap → search "Jujutsu" → **Jujutsu Bookmark** shows that name, not the raw
      action id `Jujutsu.MainToolbarBookmarks`
- [ ] `jj new` off a bookmarked change with nothing left ahead of it — label shows "\<name\> +1" (jj-idea-l7wd, GitHub #62), where `<name>` is the nearest ancestor bookmark and `+1` the number of changes since it; label is blank only when @ has no bookmark anywhere in its ancestry
- [ ] Two bookmarks equally close to @ (e.g. either side of a merge) — label lists both names, comma-separated, before the shared `+N`
- [ ] Label updates reactively: run `jj bookmark create foo` in the terminal — label changes to "foo" within ~300 ms, without saving a file or restarting (see MT-LOG-REFRESH); `jj new` afterwards updates it to "foo +1" the same way
- [ ] Click the widget — dropdown opens with "Create Bookmark Here…", then "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" at the top
- [ ] Dropdown lists all local bookmarks in the repo (not just those on @, and including bookmarks beyond the log limit), each as a sub-menu
- [ ] For a bookmark **on @**: sub-menu contains Advance, Rename…, Delete, Forget (no Move Here)
- [ ] For a bookmark **not on @**: sub-menu contains Move…, Advance, Rename…, Delete, Forget
- [ ] Remote bookmarks (e.g. `master@origin`) are folded into the corresponding local bookmark's sub-menu as Track/Untrack, not shown as separate top-level items
- [ ] "Create Bookmark Here…" (enter name → confirm) creates the bookmark at @, label and log
      decorations update; Rename… renames it in log and label; Delete removes it (label
      reverts to blank if it was on @); Forget (remote entry) removes remote tracking
- [ ] jj-idea-rskx: Create/Delete/Forget context-menu items show distinct bookmark-pennant
      icons (plus/cross/minus overlay), not the platform's generic +/trash/- icons
- [ ] jj-idea-rskx: a bookmark deleted locally but not yet pushed (`jj bookmark delete X`)
      shows a dashed/hollow pennant in the log chip (in addition to strikethrough text); a
      conflicted bookmark (e.g. after a divergent fetch) shows a red forked-tail pennant
      instead of the generic red warning triangle. Both remain legible at 125%/150% IDE
      text size and in both Light and Dark themes
- [ ] The log window's filter row (Root/Reference/Author/Date) no longer shows a Bookmark chip

#### Multi-repo project

- [ ] Bookmark widget is present in the main toolbar (not hidden)
- [ ] Label is blank regardless of which bookmarks exist (the "name +N" fallback only applies to a single-repo project — see jj-idea-1ra9 for the wrong-repo-ancestry bug this must not repeat)
- [ ] Click the widget — dropdown shows one sub-menu **per repo**, named by repo display name
- [ ] Each repo sub-menu contains the same structure as the single-repo dropdown: "Create Bookmark Here…", then "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy", then the repo's bookmark sub-menus
- [ ] "Create Bookmark Here…" inside repo-a's sub-menu creates a bookmark at **repo-a's** working copy, not repo-b's (check via `jj bookmark list` in each repo)
- [ ] `jj new` past every bookmark in repo-a only (repo-b still has one on @) — repo-a's "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" is enabled and targets repo-a's nearest bookmark; repo-b's advances repo-b's bookmark, unaffected by repo-a
- [ ] Rename/Delete/Forget in repo-b's sub-menu affects only repo-b

#### Status-bar fallback (jj-idea-cpno)

**Code:** `ui/statusbar/JujutsuBookmarkStatusBarWidget.kt`, `JujutsuBookmarkStatusBarWidgetFactory.kt`

- [ ] New UI, Settings → Appearance & Behavior → uncheck "Show main toolbar" → the main-toolbar
      bookmark widget disappears and an equivalent bookmark widget appears in the status bar
      (bottom of the IDE window), live, without restarting; re-check the setting → reverses
- [ ] Switch to Classic UI (no main toolbar exists at all) → the bookmark status-bar widget is
      present
- [ ] The status-bar widget shows the same text as the main-toolbar widget would (bookmark on @,
      or nearest-ancestor "name +N"), and clicking it opens the identical dropdown (Create,
      Advance, per-bookmark Move/Rename/Delete/Forget/Track)
- [ ] With the main toolbar visible (New UI default), the bookmark status-bar widget is **not**
      shown — only the main-toolbar widget is
- [ ] Non-jj project: neither the main-toolbar widget nor the status-bar fallback appears
- [ ] jj-idea-0hw4 (GitHub #100): in that non-jj project, run **Jujutsu → Init** — the
      main-toolbar widget (or its status-bar fallback, per the current toolbar-visibility
      setting) appears immediately, without restarting the IDE
- [ ] jj-idea-z5uu (GitHub #95): the status-bar fallback's padding, text colour, hover fill, and
      pressed fill all match a stock status-bar widget (e.g. the encoding widget) at rest, on
      hover, and while the mouse button is held down — check in both a light and a dark theme;
      dark theme hover must go **lighter**, not darker

#### Advance Bookmark (jj-idea-l7wd, GitHub #61)

- [ ] With exactly one bookmark closest to @: clicking "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" moves it directly to @, no dialog — confirm via `jj bookmark list` or the updated log decoration
- [ ] With two+ equidistant closest bookmarks (e.g. `jj new` off a merge of two bookmarked branches): clicking "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" opens a picker dialog listing all of them, pre-checked; unchecking one and confirming advances only the checked ones
- [ ] The per-bookmark "Advance … to Working Copy" action (in a bookmark's own sub-menu, or via right-click on its chip in the log) moves that specific bookmark to @ regardless of distance, without opening a picker
- [ ] Advancing a bookmark that's already at @ is a no-op (no error)
- [ ] With no bookmark anywhere in @'s ancestry: "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" is visible but disabled, with a tooltip explaining there's nothing to advance
- [ ] **Version gating**: with a jj executable below 0.39 configured (Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → jj executable path), both "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" and the per-bookmark Advance action are visible but disabled, with a tooltip naming the required version and your current one, and Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → Install/Upgrade shows the correct upgrade command for your detected install method (see also MT-WORKINGCOPY's "Version-Gated Feature Upgrade Nudge", jj-idea-sov0, for the startup balloon this same gating also surfaces)
- [ ] The disabled reason is also appended to the menu item's own text, not just its tooltip (menus don't reliably show tooltips) — e.g. "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy (needs jj 0.39+)" or "Advance 'main' to Working Copy (needs jj 0.39+)"; with no bookmark anywhere in @'s ancestry, "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy (nothing to advance)"
- [ ] jj-idea-xsa8 (GitHub #61): the same "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" action is also available as an
      icon button in the Working Copy tool window's toolbar, alongside New Change/Split/Squash/
      Abandon/Create Bookmark/Set Tag (see MT-WORKINGCOPY) — clicking it there behaves identically
      to the bookmark widget's menu item, including the picker for equidistant bookmarks and
      version gating; switching the bound repository via the panel's dropdown in a multi-root
      project re-evaluates the button against the newly selected repo
- [ ] jj-idea-xsa8 follow-up: the tooltip names the actual bookmark(s) it would move rather than
      generic wording — "Move 'main' forward to the working copy (jj bookmark advance)" for one
      candidate, "Move 'main', 'feature' forward…" (each name individually quoted) for two+
      equidistant ones — both from the bookmark widget's menu item and the Working Copy toolbar
      button
- [ ] jj-idea-xsa8 follow-up: after a successful advance — **both** the direct single-bookmark
      path and after confirming the equidistant-candidates picker — a balloon notification
      appears: "Bookmark Advanced" / "Advanced '\<name\>' to \<shortid\>", where \<shortid\>
      matches `jj log -r @`'s change id. This is deliberately the *only* one of the Working Copy
      toolbar's actions with this treatment (see MT-WORKINGCOPY) — advancing is the only one with
      no dialog on its common path and no other visible effect in that panel
- [ ] jj-idea-xsa8 follow-up: clicking the Working Copy toolbar's Advance button with exactly one
      nearest bookmark shows a "Advance Bookmark" Yes/No confirmation naming the bookmark before
      moving it — Yes advances (and still shows the completion notification above), No/Escape
      leaves the bookmark untouched. This confirmation is specific to the toolbar's icon button —
      clicking the same "Advance Bookmark to Working Copy" entry from the bookmark widget's dropdown menu or
      the log's right-click menu still advances immediately with **no** confirmation, since those
      are more deliberate two-step clicks than an icon-only toolbar button. The equidistant-
      candidates picker dialog (multiple close bookmarks) is unaffected either way — it already
      served as its own confirmation before this change

#### Move direction (forward / backward-sideways / resolve)

Covers `actions/bookmark/MoveBookmarkDialog.kt`, `MoveBookmarkToChangeDialog.kt`,
`BookmarkClassifier.kt`. jj-idea-tvch: in a repo with any divergent change, every move used to
be misclassified as backward/sideways.

- [ ] Right-click a commit that is a **descendant** of an existing bookmark → "Move Bookmark
      Here…" → the bookmark row shows the forward (move-up) icon at full opacity, is selectable,
      and OK enables **without** ticking "Allow backward or sideways move"
- [ ] Right-click an **ancestor** of the bookmark instead → the bookmark row is greyed out with
      the warning icon and is only selectable after ticking the checkbox; confirming without the
      checkbox is impossible (OK stays disabled)
- [ ] Right-click a bookmark → "Move '\<bookmark\>' to Change…" → descendants of the bookmark's
      current position show as forward/selectable; ancestors are greyed with the warning icon
      until the checkbox is ticked
- [ ] In a repo containing a divergent change (`jj log` shows `(divergent)` on some commit): the
      forward/backward classification above still works for bookmarks unrelated to the divergent
      change — it doesn't blank out to "everything backward" the way it did before jj-idea-tvch
- [ ] Confirming a forward move without ticking the checkbox actually runs `jj bookmark set`
      without `-B` (check via `jj op log` or that the bookmark moved) — no unexpected
      "backwards or sideways" retry prompt
- [ ] jj-idea-499t: confirming a move from **both** dialogs shows an undo balloon reading "Move
      bookmark"; clicking Undo puts the bookmark back where it was. "Move Bookmark Here…" already
      had this; "Move '\<bookmark\>' to Change…" did not — it moved the bookmark with no balloon
      and no undo support at all

**jj-idea-t7cz (GitHub #121): resolving a divergent bookmark back onto one of its own targets.**
Build a divergent bookmark with the `conflicted-bm` recipe in the "Bookmarks panel" subsection's
jj-idea-5r0g item, below.

- [ ] Right-click `<rev-a>` (one of `conflicted-bm`'s two targets) → "Move Bookmark Here…" →
      `conflicted-bm` now appears (it used to be silently excluded when `<rev-a>` happened to be
      jj's *first* `added_targets` entry), under a **"Resolve conflict"** section header, with the
      red conflict glyph instead of the forward/backward icon, at full opacity, and OK enables
      **without** ticking "Allow backward or sideways move". Confirm → `jj bookmark list` shows a
      single target
- [ ] Repeat right-clicking `<rev-b>` (the other target, after re-diverging) → same behaviour —
      this row was already reachable before this change, but was labelled/greyed as an ordinary
      backward move; it must now read as a resolve too
- [ ] Right-click `conflicted-bm` itself → "Move 'conflicted-bm' to Change…" → both `<rev-a>` and
      `<rev-b>` appear together under **"Resolve conflict (bookmark is divergent)"**; every other
      commit sits under Backward/Sideways behind the checkbox, none under Forward (a conflicted
      bookmark never classifies FORWARD)
- [ ] Regression: a **non-divergent** bookmark's own current change is still absent from both
      dialogs (plain no-op exclusion unaffected), and forward/backward sectioning for ordinary
      moves is unchanged

#### Per-bookmark push (jj-idea-t29z, GitHub #81)

`pushBookmarkAction` opens the same Push dialog as MT-GIT, pre-selected to "Specific bookmark"
scope with this bookmark (and the chosen remote) already selected — skipping the repo/remote/
bookmark selection clicks a fresh dialog needs, while still requiring an OK click before
anything is pushed (pushing mutates a shared remote, so this is deliberately not a one-click
fire-and-forget action). Reachable from every surface that shows a bookmark's other actions
(Rename…, Delete, Forget): the bookmark's own sub-menu in this widget, the log row's Bookmark
submenu, and a right-click on the bookmark's chip in the log.

Whether there's anything to push is evaluated **per remote**, using that remote's own
`name@remote` tracking entry — deliberately not the local bookmark's own aggregate ahead/behind
count, which in a **colocated** repo (this plugin always colocates) is always `0` because jj
auto-tracks a same-commit `@git` remote alongside any real ones. Getting this wrong makes every
bookmark look permanently up to date; the checks below exist specifically to catch that.

Setup: a repository with a local bookmark tracked against exactly one Git remote, and — for the
multi-remote cases — a second Git remote configured (`jj git remote add <name> <url>`). The
`/tmp/jj-idea-push-test` scratch repo (see jj-idea-ehki's fix) already has all three states set
up: `main` (tracked, in sync on both remotes), `feature` (pending deletion, still present on
both remotes), `new-thing` (never tracked anywhere).

- [ ] Right-click a bookmark's chip in the log (or open its sub-menu from this widget) → a Push
  entry appears alongside Rename…/Delete/Forget, with the same push icon as the toolbar Push
  action
- [ ] With exactly one Git remote: a single "Push '\<name\>' to \<remote\>..." entry, not a
  submenu; clicking it opens the Push dialog with "Specific bookmark" scope, this bookmark, and
  this remote already selected — confirming with OK is enough
- [ ] With two or more Git remotes: the entry becomes a "Push '\<name\>' to ▸" submenu, one item
  per remote, each independently labelled/enabled (see below) — clicking one opens the dialog
  pre-selected to that specific remote
- [ ] A bookmark that's up to date on `origin` (`main@origin` at the same commit as local `main`)
  shows that remote's entry **disabled**, with "(up to date)" appended to the text (a disabled
  item's tooltip alone is easy to miss in a menu) — **even though** the same bookmark is also
  tracked by the automatic colocated `@git` remote at the same commit as local (this is the
  actual regression case: confirm it stays disabled, not "always enabled because @git matches")
- [ ] The same bookmark, if ahead on a second remote (`main@github` behind local `main`), shows
  **that** remote's entry enabled while `origin`'s stays disabled — the two are evaluated
  independently
- [ ] A bookmark that has never been tracked/pushed to a given remote still shows an **enabled**
  entry for it despite having nothing to compare against yet — opening it and confirming creates
  it on that remote (with the usual "will create a new remote bookmark" confirmation from MT-GIT)
- [ ] Cancelling the pre-populated dialog performs no push
- [ ] (jj-idea-ehki) On a pending-deletion bookmark (`jj bookmark delete <name>`, still shown
  strikethrough in the log) that's still present on a remote: that remote's entry is **enabled**
  (deletions don't show up in `aheadCount`) and opens the dialog with `<name> (deleted)`
  pre-selected; confirming runs the same "will be deleted from the remote" warning as MT-GIT,
  then removes the bookmark from that remote. A remote the deletion has already been pushed to
  (or that never had the bookmark) shows its entry **disabled**

#### Push to all tracking remotes (jj-idea-ndzp)

With two or more Git remotes, the submenu above gains a leading "Push '\<name\>' to all remotes"
entry plus a separator, ahead of the per-remote entries. Unlike the per-remote entries, this one
skips the Push dialog entirely — it goes straight to a dry-run push per remote that has
something to push, so the usual force-push/deletion/untracked-bookmark confirmations still fire,
one per affected remote.

- [ ] With exactly one Git remote, no "all remotes" entry appears — just the single per-remote
  entry as before
- [ ] With two or more remotes, "Push '\<name\>' to all remotes" appears first, followed by a
  separator, then the per-remote entries unchanged
- [ ] A bookmark up to date on every remote shows the "all remotes" entry **disabled**, with
  "(up to date)" appended
- [ ] A bookmark ahead on only one of several remotes shows the entry **enabled**; clicking it
  pushes only that remote (verify via `jj git remote list`/the remote's log) — the up-to-date
  remote is silently skipped, not redundantly pushed
- [ ] A bookmark moved backwards/sideways on a remote it would push to: clicking "all remotes"
  still shows the same force-push confirmation as a per-remote push, scoped to that one remote

#### Bookmarks panel (jj-idea-b2ae, GitHub #48)

**Code:** `ui/log/bookmarks/JujutsuBookmarksPanel.kt`, `ui/log/bookmarks/BookmarkTreeModel.kt`, `ui/log/bookmarks/BookmarkNodeTooltip.kt` (jj-idea-uyu9), `ui/log/bookmarks/BookmarksStripeButton.kt`, `actions/bookmark/bookmarkLogActions.kt`, `actions/bookmark/deleteBookmarkAction.kt`, `actions/bookmark/forgetBookmarkAction.kt`, `actions/bookmark/renameBookmarkAction.kt`, `actions/bookmark/advanceBookmarkAction.kt`, `actions/bookmark/toggleTrackBookmarkAction.kt`, `actions/bookmark/pushBookmarkAction.kt` (registered, keymap-assignable counterparts, jj-idea-ib1i), `actions/EnterBoundAction.kt`, `actions/JujutsuDataKeys.kt` (`BOOKMARK_TARGET`/`BOOKMARK_TARGETS`), `ui/common/CommitTablePanel.kt` (`installLeftComponent`), `settings/LogWindowConfig.kt` (`bookmarkNodeExpanded`), `jj/cli/CliLogService.kt` (`bookmarkListTemplate`, `localBookmarkTemplate`, `remoteBookmarkTemplate`), `jj/BookmarkDivergence.kt` (`withDerivedDivergence`, jj-idea-ks5k/j58e), `jj/Revset.kt` (`Bookmark.withDivergenceFrom`), `ui/log/UnifiedJujutsuLogDataLoader.kt` (`enrichBookmarks`), `jj/ClosestBookmarks.kt` (`danglingHeads`, jj-idea-lig7)
**Also re-run:** MT-LOG-TABLE, MT-LOG-DETAILS (jj-idea-uyu9 follow-up: the commit-row tooltip and
details panel now also show a dangling-head's "N commits ahead of..." status, via
`ui/log/JujutsuGraphAndDescriptionRenderer.kt`/`ui/log/JujutsuCommitDetailsPanel.kt` reading
`JujutsuStateModel.danglingHeads`)

A tree of bookmarks/tags to the left of the log table, in the Jujutsu log tab — modelled on
git4idea's Branches dashboard. Expanded by default (matching the root gutter's default). A
narrow always-visible strip with a bookmark icon sits at the far left, outside the panel's own
splitter — clicking it toggles the panel even while collapsed, so there's always something on
screen to bring it back; the same toggle also lives in the toolbar's View Options popup. Plain
selection does nothing; right-click for actions.

- [ ] Panel starts expanded on a fresh log tab
- [ ] Clicking the bookmark-icon strip at the far left collapses the panel; the strip itself
  stays visible (tooltip switches to "Expand Bookmarks Panel") and clicking it again re-expands
- [ ] "Show Bookmarks Panel" in the toolbar's View Options popup (below the Details Position
  toggles) reflects and controls the same state as the strip
- [ ] With bookmarks `feature/A`, `feature/B`, `fix/C`: a "Local" group contains a `feature`
  group (with `A`, `B` underneath) and `fix` (with `C` underneath) — not three flat top-level
  entries
- [ ] A tracked `main@origin` appears under an `origin` group, itself `/`-grouped the same way
- [ ] jj-idea-j0zv: in a **colocated** repo, no `git` group appears among the remote groups (only
  real remotes like `origin`/`github`) — a bookmark tracked by both `@git` and a real remote still
  appears correctly under the real remote
- [ ] jj-idea-ita2: an **untracked** remote bookmark shows the untracked icon (not the tracked
  one), and right-clicking it offers **Track**, not Untrack; a bookmark ahead/behind its remote
  shows `↑n`/`↓m` on its leaf
- [ ] jj-idea-we1n (GitHub #110): a **local** bookmark ahead of its tracked remote also shows
  `↑n`/`↓m` on its own leaf under Local (not just on the `@origin` leaf) — advance the local
  bookmark past its remote (e.g. `jj bookmark set <name> -r <newer-rev>` without pushing) and
  confirm the Local leaf picks up `↑1`
- [ ] jj-idea-5r0g (GitHub #110): a conflicted/divergent local bookmark still appears under Local
  with the same red conflict icon the log table shows for it, instead of disappearing from the
  panel. To force a conflict in a sandbox repo, create the bookmark on a **third** revision — a
  common ancestor of the two you're about to diverge it to, not either one of them itself (if the
  bookmark already targets `<rev-a>` when you capture `$OP`, the first `set` below is a no-op —
  "Nothing changed." — and jj never records it as a real operation, so there's nothing for the
  second `set` to diverge from and no conflict results):
  ```sh
  jj bookmark create conflicted-bm -r <common-ancestor-rev>
  OP=$(jj op log --no-graph --limit 1 -T 'id.short()')
  jj bookmark set conflicted-bm -r <rev-a> --allow-backwards --at-op "$OP"
  jj bookmark set conflicted-bm -r <rev-b> --allow-backwards --at-op "$OP"
  ```
  `jj bookmark list` should print `conflicted-bm (conflicted):` with two `+` targets (`<rev-a>`
  and `<rev-b>`) before you check the panel.
- [ ] jj-idea-bico: `conflicted-bm` still renders as a **single** Local node (not two), and the
  panel's right-click context-menu actions on it are unaffected by this change *except* Move
  Bookmark Here…/Move '\<bookmark\>' to Change… - jj-idea-bico only made every target reachable
  *by drag*, it doesn't split the node; the two move dialogs' own divergent-resolve behavior is
  covered separately by MT-BOOKMARK's "Move direction" jj-idea-t7cz item, above
- [ ] jj-idea-ks5k (GitHub #110): with `conflicted-bm` from the recipe above still in place, open
  the bookmarks panel **and** the log table side by side — `conflicted-bm`'s `↑n`/`↓m` on its
  Local leaf must be **identical** in both, and must read as the counts a non-divergent bookmark
  sitting at `<rev-a>` would show relative to `<rev-b>` (i.e. real bidirectional divergence, not
  jj's own one-directional `tracking_ahead_count`/`tracking_behind_count` hint — panel and log
  used to disagree here, and the log showed nothing at all for a local bookmark's own divergence)
- [ ] jj-idea-j58e (GitHub #110): with `[remotes.origin] auto-track-created-bookmarks = "*"` set
  in `jj config edit --repo` (or equivalent), create a brand-new local bookmark and don't push it
  — neither the new bookmark's Local leaf nor its `@origin` leaf shows an arrow or a number,
  collapsed or expanded, in either the panel or the log (this is the reporter's own repro of the
  "↑1000+" bug); a normal ahead/behind bookmark elsewhere in the same repo is unaffected
- [ ] Tags appear under their own "Tags" group, also `/`-grouped
- [ ] An "@" node at the top shows the same text as the main-toolbar bookmark widget (e.g. "main"
  or "main +3") — create/delete a bookmark and confirm both update together
- [ ] The "@" node's label is bookmark-coloured, followed by a bold "@" glyph in the log's own
  working-copy colour (same colour as the "@" the log table appends after a working-copy row's
  bookmarks/tags — compare side by side)
- [ ] Local/remote bookmark leaves, and their "Local"/remote-name folder groups, render in the
  same brownish colour as bookmark chips in the log table
- [ ] Tag leaves, and the "Tags" folder group, render in the same greenish colour as tag chips in
  the log table
- [ ] A bookmark sitting on `@` renders **bold** (still bookmark-coloured) in the tree
- [ ] Right-click a local bookmark → same actions as its dropdown sub-menu (Move…/Advance/
  Rename…/Delete/Forget, minus Move… when it's on @), plus "Filter Log to Bookmark" and
  "Navigate Log to Bookmark" at the bottom
- [ ] "Filter Log to Bookmark" narrows the log the same way the reference filter does
- [ ] "Navigate Log to Bookmark" scrolls/selects that bookmark's change, including one outside
  the currently loaded log window (triggers an expanding load, same as clicking a bookmark chip)
- [ ] Right-click a remote bookmark → Track/Untrack, plus Filter/Navigate
- [ ] Right-click a tag → Delete, plus Navigate (no Filter — tags aren't a log filter reference
  here), plus New Change/Edit/Rebase/Duplicate the same as a bookmark row (jj-idea-p35f follow-up)
- [ ] Right-click the "@" node → Create Bookmark Here…, Advance Bookmark to Working Copy
- [ ] With an issue-tracker pattern configured (Settings → Version Control → Issue Navigation) and
  a bookmark named e.g. `JIRA-123-fix-thing`: the `JIRA-123` portion of its label renders as a
  link (same styling as the log table/description) while the rest of the name doesn't; hovering it
  shows a hand cursor and clicking opens the configured issue URL in a browser. Same for a tag
  named the same way, and for the "@" node when the bookmark on `@` has such a name
- [ ] Clicking elsewhere on a linked bookmark's row (its icon, or non-linked text) does not open a
  browser — only the linked portion is clickable
- [ ] Renaming/creating/deleting a bookmark in the terminal updates the tree reactively, without
  a manual refresh (same auto-refresh path as MT-LOG-REFRESH)
- [ ] Multi-repo project: one top-level group per repository (with its icon), each containing its
  own Local/remote/Tags structure; single-repo project has no such wrapper level
- [ ] Type while the tree has focus — speed search jumps to/filters matching bookmark names
- [ ] Restart the IDE — the panel's expanded/collapsed state is restored per log window
- [ ] jj-idea-a7a7: with 2+ real remotes, each remote group starts **collapsed**; "Local" and
  "Tags" start expanded, as before
- [ ] jj-idea-a7a7: manually collapse "Local" and expand a remote group — restart the IDE (or
  close/reopen the log tab) — both the manual collapse and the manual expand persist, per log
  window (a second log window with a different layout is unaffected)
- [ ] jj-idea-a7a7: with a remote group collapsed and one of its bookmarks ahead/behind or
  untracked, the group's own row shows a roll-up `↑n`/`↓m` (or a plain dot if only untracked)
  in the same divergence colour as the leaf chips; expanding the group hides the roll-up and
  shows the normal per-bookmark indicators instead
- [ ] jj-idea-a7a7: the panel's toolbar has **Expand All** / **Collapse All** buttons that expand
  or collapse every group at once (including remote groups), and both toggles persist the same
  way manual clicks do
- [ ] jj-idea-ib1i (GitHub #48 split 1/3): Settings → Keymap → search "Jujutsu" — Navigate to
  Bookmark's Change, Filter Log to Bookmark, Delete/Forget/Rename/Advance/Push Bookmark to All
  Remotes, and Track/Untrack Bookmark all appear and can be rebound
- [ ] jj-idea-ib1i: right-clicking a bookmark row's actions (Delete/Forget/Rename/Advance/Push to
  all remotes/Track-Untrack) show a keymap shortcut hint next to any that have been bound, the
  same way New Change/Edit/Rebase do in the log
- [ ] jj-idea-ib1i: double-clicking a bookmark row navigates the log to that bookmark's change
  (same as "Navigate Log to Bookmark"); rebind Enter in Keymap settings to a different bound
  action and confirm double-click follows the new binding
- [ ] jj-idea-ib1i: double-clicking the linked portion of a bookmark name (issue-tracker pattern
  configured) still opens the browser, not the Enter-bound action
- [ ] jj-idea-ib1i: Ctrl+Click to select two bookmark rows, then right-click **inside** that
  selection — the multi-selection is preserved (not collapsed to the row under the cursor)
- [ ] jj-idea-p35f (GitHub #48 split 2/3): right-click a local or remote bookmark row — New
  Change, New Change..., Edit Change, Rebase, and Duplicate all appear alongside the existing
  bookmark actions, reusing the same New Change/Edit/Rebase instances as the log toolbar
  (shortcut hints included)
- [ ] jj-idea-p35f: Ctrl+Click two bookmark rows whose changes are both loaded in the log, then
  "New Change From These" — creates a merge change with both as parents
- [ ] jj-idea-p35f: select a bookmark whose change is **not** in the currently loaded log window
  (e.g. a far-back bookmark in a filtered/paginated log) — New Change/Edit/Rebase/Duplicate show
  disabled rather than acting on the wrong change
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7 (GitHub #107): `jj new` off a bookmarked change, twice, without moving the
  bookmark (leaving two unbookmarked heads) — an "Unbookmarked heads" group appears right after
  the "@" node and before "Local", listing both, each as "\<closest bookmark\> +n \<change id\>"
  (bookmark-coloured label, change id in the log's own bold-prefix/grey-remainder style)
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7: a dangling head with no ancestor bookmark at all (e.g. a root-adjacent
  disconnected change) shows "(no bookmark) \<change id\>" instead of a `+n` count
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7: `jj bookmark set \<name\> -r \<that head\>` in the terminal — the row
  disappears from "Unbookmarked heads" after the auto-refresh, without a manual refresh
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7: double-clicking an unbookmarked-head row scrolls/selects that change in the
  log, including one outside the currently loaded window (same expanding-load behavior as
  "Navigate Log to Bookmark") — this works even though the row has no bookmark to publish as
  `BOOKMARK_TARGET`
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7: right-clicking an unbookmarked-head row offers "Navigate Log to Bookmark",
  "Create Bookmark Here…" (bookmarking it removes it from the group), and the same New
  Change/Edit/Rebase/Duplicate change actions as a bookmark row
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7: the "Unbookmarked heads" group is collapsible via the same toolbar Expand
  All/Collapse All buttons and persists its collapsed state across an IDE restart, same as
  Local/Tags/a remote group
- [ ] jj-idea-lig7: with more than 10 unbookmarked heads in the repo, the group caps at 10 rows
  rather than growing unbounded (use `scripts/fixtures/fx-stress.sh`'s stress fixture, which has
  many concurrent unbookmarked branch tips)
- [ ] jj-idea-9ck7 (GitHub #107): `jj bookmark create` a ~50-char bookmark name, then `jj new`
  twice off it without moving the bookmark — the main-toolbar bookmark widget truncates the name
  with `…` but still shows the trailing `+n`; the bookmarks panel's "@" row and the
  "Unbookmarked heads" row both show the **full, untruncated** name plus `+n` (the panel lays
  out by available width like the rest of the tree, not by the toolbar's fixed char cap)

##### Bookmark-state tooltips (jj-idea-uyu9, GitHub #110)

Hovering any row shows a compact tooltip, rendered via the same icon-aware pane the log table's
own row tooltip uses (see [Hover tooltip behaviour](#hover-tooltip-behaviour-jj-idea-wp12)'s
dismissal/scroll behavior, which applies here too). v2 redesign after user feedback on the first
cut: no beginner prose, nothing that only restates the row's own icon/arrows - a
`[GroupLabel, ...]` bracket line (with an icon), the bookmark's full `/`-qualified path, and (DRY
with the commit tooltip) the target commit's change id/commit id/author/date/description.

- [ ] Create a nested bookmark (e.g. `branches/foo/bar`) — hover its Local leaf — tooltip shows
  `[Local]`, then the full `branches/foo/bar` path (not just `bar`) with the same chip
  icon/arrows the row shows, then change id/commit id/author/date/description matching what the
  log row's own tooltip shows for that same change
- [ ] Hover the "foo" prefix node above it — bracket reads `[Local]` (not `[foo]`/`[branches]`),
  then `branches/foo`, then its own leaf count (e.g. "1 bookmark"); no commit info (a folder
  isn't a single change)
- [ ] Hover the matching `@origin` leaf — bracket reads `[origin]`
- [ ] Collapse "Local"/a remote/"Tags" — hover the folder — bracket names the group alone when
  nothing's notable; with a divergent or untracked bookmark inside, the bracket adds `↑n↓m`/
  `N unsynced`, matching the in-row collapsed badge exactly; below it, a leaf-count line ("N
  bookmarks"/"N tags", singular for exactly one) counts every leaf transitively, including
  inside collapsed/nested sub-groups
- [ ] Track a local bookmark to two remotes with different states (e.g. `origin` in sync,
  `github` behind by moving the bookmark backwards there with `--allow-backwards`) — hover the
  Local leaf — below the chip, one bracket line per remote: `[origin, in sync]`,
  `[github, ↓1, force-push required]`; a remote with no ahead/behind shows "in sync", any remote
  the local is behind (whether or not also ahead) adds "force-push required"; a local bookmark
  tracked by no remote shows no such lines. Hover the `github` leaf itself under its remote
  category — its own tooltip also flags "force-push required" when behind
- [ ] Hover a tag — bracket reads `[Tags]`, full `/`-qualified tag path, no "Tag" text, plus its
  target commit's info (change id/commit id/author/date/description, same as a bookmark's)
- [ ] Hover the "@" row on a bookmark directly — shows the bookmark name(s), no distance bracket;
  after `jj new`ing past it — compact `[N commit(s) ahead of <bookmark>]` bracket instead
  (singular "1 commit" for exactly one, "commits" otherwise; no comma before a single name,
  comma-separated for several); both cases include `@`'s own commit info, including a
  `[@ Working Copy]` tag matching the log
  row tooltip's own status tag for the working-copy commit; right-click → **Navigate Log to
  Commit** (not "...to Bookmark") works, and double-clicking the row navigates there too
  (previously a silent no-op)
- [ ] Build the "Unbookmarked heads" recipe above — the category's own tooltip reads "N heads
  without bookmarks" (singular "1 head without a bookmark" for exactly one), not a bracket; each
  row in the tree, and the category header itself, shows the same slashed-bookmark icon the log
  table uses for a dangling head; a child row's tooltip uses the same compact
  `[N commits ahead of ...]` form as the "@" row (with that same slashed-bookmark icon leading
  the bracket - the "@" row's own bracket does not have it, since the working copy isn't counted
  as a dangling head), plus commit info, and **Navigate Log to Commit** (not "...to Bookmark") on
  right-click
- [ ] With that same unbookmarked head still visible in the log table itself, hover its row —
  the row's own tooltip now also shows a `[N commits ahead of <bookmark>]` status tag (with the
  slashed-bookmark icon) alongside any other status tags (Conflict/Immutable/etc); open the
  commit details panel for the same row and confirm it shows the identical tag. Hover the
  *working-copy* row even when it itself has no bookmark on it — no such tag appears there (it's
  covered by its own `@ Working Copy` tag instead, not double-counted as a dangling head)
- [ ] Single-repo project — no tooltip shows a repo line; multi-repo project — every tooltip
  gains a leading repo icon+name line, above the group bracket
- [ ] Hover a row, then move the pointer *into* the tooltip balloon — it stays open; scroll the
  panel without moving the pointer — it hides and does not reappear until the pointer moves
  (jj-idea-wp12 regression on this surface)
- [ ] Uncheck the log toolbar's **Hover Tooltips** (renamed from "Commit Tooltips" - see
  [View options menu](#view-options-menu-jj-idea-lgo4-n22a)) — both the log row tooltip and every
  bookmarks-panel tooltip stop appearing; re-check — both come back, no restart needed

### MT-WORKINGCOPY

**Working copy panel, status bar widget, and tool window behavior**

**Code:** `ui/workingcopy/UnifiedWorkingCopyPanel.kt`, `ui/workingcopy/WorkingCopyControlsPanel.kt`, `ui/workingcopy/WorkingCopyToolWindowFactory.kt`, `ui/statusbar/JujutsuStatusBarWidget.kt`, `ui/statusbar/JujutsuWorkingCopySwitcher.kt`, `ui/services/JujutsuUiEnabler.kt`, `ui/services/WorkingCopySignpost.kt`, `ui/services/SponsorAsk.kt`, `ui/services/FeatureUpgradeNudge.kt`, `ui/services/JujutsuNotifications.kt`, `ui/services/JujutsuStartupActivity.kt`, `vcs/JujutsuHiddenCommitMode.kt` (Standard Commit Tool Window Suppression), `vcs/JujutsuVcsBase.kt`, `actions/top/InitAction.kt`, `ui/common/JujutsuChangesTree.kt`, `ui/common/JujutsuOtherRepositoriesNode.kt`, `ui/common/JujutsuNoChangesNode.kt` (repo-anchoring, jj-idea-xsa8 follow-up), `ui/common/JujutsuFilePathIconProvider.kt` (repo-root icon in changes trees), `jj/WorkingCopyRecovery.kt`, `jj/JujutsuRepositoryHealth.kt`, `ui/restore/RestoreDialog.kt`, `actions/file/RestoreSelectionAction.kt`, `actions/filechange/RestoreToChangeAction.kt` (jj-idea-g2p8, GitHub #84)
**Also re-run:** MT-DIFF-PREVIEW (changed-files tree shares the preview-tab behavior); MT-CROSS (colocated Git / multi-VCS project scoping); MT-CTXMENU, MT-SQUASH, MT-SPLIT (Split/Squash/Abandon/Create Bookmark/Advance Bookmark/Set Tag are shared with the log context menu); MT-BOOKMARK (Advance Bookmark)

#### Working Copy Panel

- [ ] jj-idea-4d7p: on a **freshly started IDE**, before touching anything, the description box is
  already populated with `@`'s description (not just the grey placeholder), and every toolbar
  button (New Change, Split, Squash, Abandon, Create Bookmark) is enabled rather than all greyed
  out
- [ ] Description text area shows current description
- [ ] jj-idea-qa8i: clicking into the description text area, typing, and pressing Enter inserts
  a newline (does not do nothing or trigger another action)
- [ ] jj-idea-n3w1 (GitHub #46): the description field is a real commit-message editor, not a
  plain text area - typing a long first line highlights the subject-length inspection, a
  misspelled word gets a spellcheck squiggle, and the toolbar's history button (Ctrl+E / Cmd+E)
  opens a popup of recently-used descriptions (shared with Git's own commit UI and every other
  description editor in this plugin)
- [ ] With IdeaVim installed: describe the working copy, enter Insert mode in the description
  field, then press Escape - it should leave Insert mode, not close/cancel anything (this was the
  requester's headline ask on GitHub #46; if Escape does something else, note what and whether
  `:set ideavimsupport=dialog` changes it)
- [ ] jj-idea-n553 (GitHub #15): with an Issue Navigation pattern configured (Settings → Version
  Control → Issue Navigation, e.g. issue `[A-Z]+-\d+` → link `https://example.com/browse/$0`),
  an issue reference like `JIRA-123` inside a bookmark name shown in the current-change summary
  (above the description area) renders as a clickable link, opening the configured URL on click
- [ ] "Describe" button updates description via `jj describe`
- [ ] "New Change" button creates new change via `jj new`
- [ ] jj-idea-xsa8 (GitHub #61): the toolbar row also offers Split, Squash, Abandon, a separator,
  then Create Bookmark, Advance Bookmark, and Set Tag — all acting on `@`, all icon-only
  (tooltip-only labels) — **verify every one of them is actually visible in the row, not
  collapsed behind an overflow `>>` chevron or silently missing**; each behaves identically to
  its log context-menu counterpart (see MT-CTXMENU, MT-SQUASH, MT-SPLIT, MT-BOOKMARK) and greys
  out (never disappears) when not applicable to the current `@` — e.g. Squash with no mutable
  parent, Advance with no ancestor bookmark
- [ ] Multi-root: switching the bound repository via the panel's dropdown re-evaluates every one
  of these buttons against the newly selected repo
- [ ] jj-idea-xsa8 follow-up: in a multi-root project, the repo selector dropdown sits in the same
  row as this toolbar (top of the tool window), not ~60% down inside the description area where
  it used to be — the two are visually adjacent, and choosing a different repo there immediately
  updates both the toolbar buttons and the description/current-change area below
- [ ] Changed files tree shows correct status colors and file type icons
- [ ] Preview-tab behavior (double-click, Enter, tab-swap, single-click-no-op-when-closed,
      single-click-swap-when-open, Escape, Cmd/Ctrl+D, F4): see MT-DIFF-PREVIEW
- [ ] Right-click shows context menu with file actions
- [ ] jj-idea-lo7u: "Compare Before with Another Commit..." is **not** in that menu (working
      copy context — same as "Compare Before with Local")

##### Restore dialog (jj-idea-g2p8, GitHub #84)

- [ ] Modify 3+ files; right-click one in the changed-files tree → **Restore** opens a dialog
      (not a plain Yes/No confirm) listing every changed file, with only the right-clicked
      file checked
- [ ] Tick an additional file before confirming → exactly the checked files revert to `@-`;
      unchecked files are untouched
- [ ] Untick every file → the OK button is disabled with a "check at least one file" message
- [ ] Invoke Restore with nothing selected in the tree (or from the editor's Jujutsu →
      Restore, single file) → dialog still opens, pre-checked, and can be widened to restore
      other changed files too — no more single-file Yes/No shortcut
- [ ] With a renamed file among the changes, checking it and confirming restores **both** the
      old and new path (no orphaned file left at either location)
- [ ] jj-idea-c2m8 (GitHub #122): delete a tracked file (`rm`) → right-click **only** that
      deleted file in the changed-files tree → **Restore** is offered (not hidden) → confirm →
      the file comes back
- [ ] jj-idea-c2m8: delete one file and edit another, select **both** in the changed-files tree
      → Restore → the dialog opens with **both** files pre-checked → confirm → both are
      restored (the deleted file used to be silently dropped from a mixed selection)
- [ ] jj-idea-c2m8: same deleted-only selection → **Show File History** still opens history for
      it (see MT-DIFF's File History section); **Squash Selected Files** / **Split** offer it
      pre-ticked in their dialogs; **Open File** stays disabled (there's no file to open)
- [ ] With a clean working copy (no pending changes), Restore shows a "Nothing to restore"
      notification instead of opening an empty dialog
- [ ] After confirming a restore, an undo balloon reading "Restore" appears with an inline
      Undo link (see MT-WORKINGCOPY's Undo section, jj-idea-v9zp/jj-idea-g2p8) - clicking it
      brings the discarded content back
- [ ] See MT-LOG-DETAILS for the historical "Restore to This" variant of this same dialog
- [ ] Select one or more files in the changed-files tree → the IDE's **Reformat Code**
      (Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+L) and **Optimize Imports** (Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+O) both act on the selected file(s),
      same as the built-in Git/Commit changes view (`JujutsuChangesTree.showsLocalFiles`)
- [ ] Right-click a file → Jujutsu submenu → **Annotate** opens the gutter annotations for that
      file (jj-idea-0t5o)
- [ ] Open shows working copy as editable
- [ ] Open for multiple files opens multiple editors
- [ ] Menu has Open in -> remote; see MT-DIFF for "Open in -> remote for single parent" and the hidden-when-no-pushed-ancestor case
- [ ] jj-idea-t0zo: in a repository that is colocated with Git (mapped to both Jujutsu and
  Git4Idea), the Working Copy panel's changed-files tree shows only jj's changes — no
  Git-only changes appear. Also verify "Resolve Conflicts…" (both the toolbar/menu action
  and the per-file context menu action) only offers jj-tracked conflicted files
- [ ] jj-idea-mdi4: in a repository mapped to a non-jj VCS (e.g. Git4Idea, colocated or
  otherwise), select a change belonging to that other VCS in the Changes view and press F4
  / open the context menu — no `VcsException: Not a Jujutsu revision` appears in the IDE
  log, and jj's file-change actions (Open, Compare, Restore, etc.) simply don't offer that
  change

#### Changes tree repo-anchoring (jj-idea-xsa8 follow-up, multi-repo only)

Covers `ui/common/JujutsuChangesTree.kt`'s `currentRepo`, `JujutsuOtherRepositoriesNode`,
`JujutsuOtherRepositoryNode`, and `JujutsuNoChangesNode`: the changes tree spans every repo,
unlike the toolbar/description above it (which only ever act on the bound repo), so changes
belonging to any *other* repo are demoted into one collapsed node rather than getting an
equally-weighted group of their own.

- [ ] With a repo bound (via the relocated selector) that **has** changes: that repo's changed
  files show directly at the top level of the tree (still grouped by directory as normal) — **not**
  wrapped in their own repo-named node the way they were before this feature
- [ ] With a repo bound that has **no** changes (e.g. a fresh/clean `@`): the tree still shows a
  line for it — the repo's name followed by a grey "(no changes)" qualifier — rather than showing
  nothing at all for the bound repo (easy to misread as broken, especially when "Other
  Repositories" below it is populated)
- [ ] Every *other* repo's changed files are collapsed under a single "Other Repositories" node,
  sorted below the bound repo's own files/no-changes line, collapsed by default (not expanded) the
  first time it appears
- [ ] Expand "Other Repositories" with changes from **two or more** other repos present: each
  other repo appears as its **own named sub-node**, with the same per-repo colored icon used
  elsewhere (bookmark widget's multi-repo dropdown, the "(no changes)" line), directly followed
  by its changed files — **no** extra node in between for a shared parent directory (e.g. the
  folder containing several sibling repos on disk) or for the repo itself appearing twice nested
- [ ] A file inside a subdirectory of an other-repo (e.g. `src/Main.kt`) shows as just its
  filename ("Main.kt") directly under that repo's node, **not** nested under its own directory
  sub-tree the way the bound repo's own files are, and **not** showing any path (relative or
  absolute) as part of its label — this is a deliberate trade-off (see jj-idea-xsa8) for a
  demoted, secondary area of the tree; only the bound repo's own top-level content gets full
  directory grouping
- [ ] Switch the bound repo via the selector — the split re-partitions immediately (files move
  between the plain top level / "Other Repositories", the no-changes line appears or disappears as
  appropriate), no need to touch Refresh
- [ ] Single-repo project: no "Other Repositories" node ever appears, regardless of how many
  changed files exist — behavior is unchanged from before this feature; the no-changes line is
  also unaffected (single-repo behavior is untouched by `currentRepo`, since it was already the
  only repo shown)
- [ ] With conflicts present (`groupConflicts`): the Merge Conflicts node (top, bold) and the
  Other Repositories node (bottom, sorted after the bound repo's own content) coexist correctly —
  a conflicted file in another repo appears under Merge Conflicts, not duplicated under Other
  Repositories

#### Repository Initialization (jj-idea-uw11)

- [ ] With a directory that is VCS-mapped to Jujutsu but has no `.jj` (shows the
  "uninitialized root" notification), click **Initialize** on the notification, pick the
  directory, confirm → the Working copy tool window populates with the repo's changes
  immediately, without needing any further unrelated action (e.g. no `jj split` first)
- [ ] Same check using **VCS → Jujutsu → Initialize** (top-level menu action) directly on an
  already-mapped-but-uninitialized directory, instead of the notification's button
- [ ] The Log tool window also shows the initial commit(s) immediately after Initialize
- [ ] After Initialize, add/edit a file in the new repo — the editor gutter and Project view
  show the correct added/modified colour immediately, without needing to touch Settings,
  restart, or trigger an unrelated VCS refresh first

#### Unreadable Repository (jj-idea-9ife)

- [ ] With a working jj repo open (tool window populated), break its store on disk
  while the IDE is running — e.g. `rm -rf .jj/repo/store` (leaves `.jj` present, so it still
  passes the "is this a jj repo" check, but `jj log` fails) — then trigger a VCS re-scan
  (e.g. touch a file, or reopen the project)
- [ ] **Expected:** no red "IDE Internal Error" balloon; instead, a single WARNING
  notification "Jujutsu Repository Could Not Be Read" appears, including jj's error detail,
  and **Retry** and **Configure VCS Mappings…** actions
- [ ] The Working copy tool window's empty state shows **"Jujutsu could not read the
  repository '\<name\>'..."**, not the generic "No Jujutsu repositories configured", with its
  own **Retry** link
- [ ] Settings → Version Control → Directory Mappings shows the broken repo's row in red
  (same treatment as an otherwise-invalid mapping)
- [ ] Trigger another refresh (e.g. edit a file) — the toast notification does not repeat,
  but the tool window's empty state and the red mapping row persist (they're not one-shot)
- [ ] Click **Retry** on the notification, or on the tool window's empty-state link — it
  re-checks immediately; while still broken, the same messages reappear (a fresh notification
  can fire again since Retry re-arms it)
- [ ] Restore the store (e.g. `jj git init --colocate .` again) **without** touching any
  other file — within ~1s the tool window, Log, and the Directory Mappings row all recover on
  their own, with no manual Retry/re-scan needed (the plugin watches the repo's `.jj/repo/`
  directory for exactly this)
- [ ] In a multi-repo project, break only one repo's store — the other repo's Working
  copy/Log data is unaffected, and the tool window's empty-state message only mentions the
  broken repo when *all* repos are unreadable (with more than one repo readable, the broken
  one is just silently absent from the dropdown, matching existing uninitialized-repo
  behavior)
- [ ] Break two repos' stores in the same project — the notification message pluralizes
  ("N Jujutsu repositories could not be read")

#### Stale Workspace (jj-idea-b65g, jj-idea-27b4)

Genuinely staling a workspace requires more than advancing the op head from another workspace —
jj's own working-copy auto-recovery silently absorbs that case. Force it instead by corrupting the
workspace's local operation pointer:

```bash
jj workspace add ../ws2   # from the sandbox repo
cd ../ws2
python3 -c '
path = ".jj/working_copy/checkout"
with open(path, "rb") as f:
    data = bytearray(f.read())
data[2] = (data[2] + 1) % 256
with open(path, "wb") as f:
    f.write(data)
'
jj status   # confirm: "Error: Could not read working copy's operation." + the update-stale hint
```
Re-run the same command (safe to repeat) any time you need to re-stale it, including after
**Update Stale Workspace** has just repaired it. Open `../ws2` as its own IDE project.

**Known gap:** Annotate still reports a stale workspace as a raw error in the platform's own
"Annotate" Messages-tool-window tab, not the notification below — a fix attempt didn't pan out
and was reverted rather than shipped half-working.

- [ ] **Expected:** no red "IDE Internal Error" balloon and no "Uncaught exception" background
  warning; instead, a WARNING notification **"Jujutsu Workspace Is Stale"** appears, with
  **Update Stale Workspace** and **Retry** actions
- [ ] The Working copy tool window's empty state shows the stale-specific message (not the
  generic "could not be read" text) with its own **Update Stale Workspace** link
- [ ] While stale: open the Working copy tool window's toolbar and context menus, and the
  changes tree — every action is simply disabled/hidden, with no uncaught exception
- [ ] Click **Update Stale Workspace** (on the notification or the empty-state link) — it runs
  `jj workspace update-stale` and the tool window/Log repopulate on their own within ~1s, with
  no manual Retry/re-scan needed
- [ ] Trigger **Advance Bookmark**, **Rename Bookmark**, **Create Bookmark**, **Move Bookmark**,
  **Set Tag**, or **Git → Push** while the workspace is stale — each shows the
  **Update Stale Workspace**/**Retry** notification (not a crash, and not a wrong message like
  "bookmark already exists"), and clicking **Update Stale Workspace** both repairs the workspace
  *and* completes the action that was interrupted (the bookmark actually advances/renames/moves,
  the push dialog actually opens)
- [ ] Open the **Squash**, **Squash Into**, **Rebase**, **Duplicate**, or **New Change** dialog
  while stale — the commit picker shows the stale notification instead of silently staying empty
  or freezing; **Update Stale Workspace** repairs it and the picker populates
- [ ] Open the **Move Bookmark** dialog while stale — it does not silently mislabel every
  candidate as "backward/sideways"; it shows the stale notification instead
- [ ] Open **Show History** on a file while stale — shows the notification, not a silently empty
  history table
- [ ] In a multi-repo project, stale only one repo's workspace — the other repo's Working
  copy/Log data is unaffected, and repo-root icons in the changes tree still render correctly
  for both (no freeze scrolling a large changes tree while one repo is stale)
- [ ] With the workspace healthy again, deliberately create a **real** bookmark name conflict
  (create a bookmark with a name that already exists) — confirm it still shows the correct
  "already exists" message (the exit-code fix must not regress the true-positive case)

#### Standard Commit Tool Window Suppression (jj-idea-wb5l)

- [ ] In a **jj-only** project (default setting), the standard **Commit** tool window and
  the **Local Changes** tab are not shown; the **Working copy** tool window is the only
  changes UI. Ctrl/Cmd+K still opens Describe (unchanged)
- [ ] Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → uncheck "Hide the standard Commit tool window"
  → the Commit tool window / Local Changes tab reappears immediately, without reopening the
  project. Re-check it → it disappears again
- [ ] With the setting on: editor-tab and Project-view file colors for added/modified files
  still render; editor gutter change markers still show; Annotate still works; the Working
  copy panel's changed-files list still updates live as files change
- [ ] In a **mixed jj + Git** project (both VCSes mapped), the standard Commit tool window
  is still shown regardless of the setting (jj is not the single active VCS, so the setting
  has no effect) — Git's own commit workflow is unaffected

#### Working Copy Tool Window Signpost (jj-idea-jqpe)

- [ ] With a fresh sandbox config (no prior `jujutsu.xml` app or project settings), open a
  jj project → the **Working copy** tool window opens on the left automatically, but keyboard
  focus stays wherever it was (e.g. the editor) — it doesn't steal focus
- [ ] A sticky balloon notification appears explaining the Working copy panel and its
  "Open Working Copy" action; clicking it activates and focuses the tool window
- [ ] Close and reopen the same project → the tool window is not force-reopened again and no
  balloon appears (both are one-shot per project/install)
- [ ] Open a **second, different** jj project in the same sandbox → the tool window opens
  automatically again (per-project), but no balloon appears (per-install, already shown)
- [ ] Open a non-jj project → neither the tool window nor the balloon appear

#### Sponsor Ask (jj-idea-z1ld)

- [ ] Fresh sandbox config, open a jj project → no sponsor balloon on first run
- [ ] Quit, backdate `firstRunEpochMillis` in the sandbox `jujutsu.xml` (under
  `JujutsuApplicationSettings`) to more than 14 days ago, restart → a sticky balloon fires
  once; clicking **Sponsor** opens `https://github.com/sponsors/kkkev` in the default browser
- [ ] Restart again → the balloon does not reappear
- [ ] Repeat the backdate in a fresh sandbox, click **Don't show again** instead → restart →
  the balloon never reappears
- [ ] The Working Copy signpost above still fires independently and is unaffected by the
  sponsor ask (both read/write disjoint fields in `JujutsuApplicationSettingsState`)

#### Version-Gated Feature Upgrade Nudge (jj-idea-sov0)

Requires the multi-version harness — see [Test Tooling](#test-tooling) — to have a jj
executable older than 0.39 available to point the plugin at.

- [ ] Fresh sandbox config, jj executable path (Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu) pointed
  at a pinned jj **below 0.39** (e.g. `~/.local/bin/jj-0.38`) → open a jj project → a balloon
  fires once naming "Advance Bookmark (needs jj 0.39)" and your current version
- [ ] Clicking **Update jj...** opens Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu
- [ ] Restart the same sandbox → the balloon does not reappear
- [ ] Repeat in a fresh sandbox, click **Don't show again** instead → restart → the balloon
  never reappears
- [ ] Change the configured jj path to a **different** old version (e.g. 0.37 instead of 0.38)
  → the balloon fires again (re-nudges per jj version)
- [ ] Point the executable path at a jj **0.39 or newer**, or clear it back to default
  resolution → no balloon at all, regardless of prior dismissal state
- [ ] Point the executable path at a jj **below the plugin's hard minimum** (0.37) → only the
  existing "jj version too old" warning appears (MT-CROSS's Error Handling) — this nudge never
  fires for that case
- [ ] Open a **non-jj** project with an old jj configured → no balloon

#### Feature-gated upgrade prompt in Installation Help (jj-idea-vcqn, jj-idea-vwni, jj-idea-258c)

Surface 1 of jj-idea-xuah — the passive counterpart to the nudge balloon above. Requires the
same multi-version harness (see [Test Tooling](#test-tooling)). `JjVersion.MINIMUM` is currently
0.37.0 — a pinned jj exactly at or above that but below 0.39.0 (e.g. 0.37.x/0.38.x) is Scenario B
(gated on a feature); anything below 0.37.0 is Scenario A (below the plugin's hard minimum).

This started as its own standalone "Feature Availability" group (jj-idea-vcqn), then a linked
pair with Installation Help (jj-idea-vwni); jj-idea-258c folded the gated-feature list directly
into Installation Help's own description, since the standalone group and its "see Installation
Help above" pointer amounted to filler for what's fundamentally one message: "here's what's
wrong and here's how to fix it."

- [ ] With a current jj configured, open Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → expand
  "Installation Help" — reads "If jj is not installed, use one of these commands:" (no feature
  list) — this is the "everything's fine" case, so there's nothing else to say here
- [ ] Point the jj executable path at a pinned jj **below 0.39 but ≥ 0.37.0** (e.g.
  `~/.local/bin/jj-0.38`), click Apply, **without closing Settings** — "Installation Help"
  auto-expands live, from the same Apply that reran availability detection. Content is a
  one-shot snapshot at panel-open time though (see below), so close and reopen Settings with
  the same path still configured to see it read: "Your current jj version is too old. Upgrade
  now to unlock these features:" followed by an **indented bullet line** "• Advance Bookmark
  *(needs jj 0.39.0)*" — the "*(needs jj 0.39.0)*" part in grey secondary text, not the same
  weight as the feature name — then "Upgrade using:" and the **upgrade** commands
  (`brew upgrade jj`, not `brew install jj`). No separate group, no "now expanded" or similar
  filler phrasing anywhere on the page.
- [ ] Point the executable path at a jj **below the plugin's hard minimum** (e.g. 0.36), Apply,
  reopen Settings — Installation Help reads "Your current jj version is too old. Upgrade using:"
  with upgrade commands, but **no feature list** — Scenario A already has its own balloon and
  JjNotInstalledPanel (MT-CROSS's Error Handling), so this must not double-report feature gating
  on top of those
- [ ] Clear the path back to default resolution (a current jj) — Installation Help **stays
  expanded** (deliberate — the plugin never auto-collapses a group once opened, in case you
  opened it yourself) but its content still needs a Settings reopen to drop back to the
  "if jj is not installed" wording, per the one-shot-snapshot limitation above

#### Status Bar Widget (Switch Working Copy)

- [ ] jj-idea-0hw4 (GitHub #100): open a plain Git or no-VCS project (no `.jj` root) — the
  Jujutsu working-copy status-bar widget does not appear; running **Jujutsu → Init** in that
  project makes it appear immediately, without restarting the IDE
- [ ] jj-idea-fmrj: click the Jujutsu widget in the IDE status bar to open the "Switch Working
  Copy" popup, in a repo with at least one local bookmark and one tag
- [ ] Hover a bookmark or tag row — tooltip shows the bookmark/tag chip (icon + name, correct
  accent color) followed by `(changeid)`, with **no broken-image glyph**
- [ ] Hover a change row — tooltip shows change id, commit id, author (as a mailto link),
  timestamp and description, each on its own line
- [ ] Move the pointer between rows without leaving the list — tooltip content updates to the
  newly hovered row
- [ ] jj-idea-wp12: hover a row with enough entries that the list scrolls, then scroll it
  (mouse wheel or scrollbar) without moving the pointer — the tooltip disappears and does not
  reappear until the pointer moves
- [ ] Regression: hover a commit row in the Jujutsu log — its tooltip still renders bookmark/tag
  chips correctly and still reflows/scrolls for a commit with many bookmarks (jj-idea-szn8)
- [ ] jj-idea-6nas: `jj describe` @ with a very long single-line description — the widget's
  label ellipsizes and other status bar widgets (line/column, encoding, memory, notifications)
  stay visible, both at full window width and after shrinking the IDE window to ~900px; hovering
  the widget's tooltip still shows the full, untruncated description
- [ ] jj-idea-z5uu (GitHub #95): the widget's padding, text colour, hover fill, and pressed fill
  all match a stock status-bar widget (e.g. the encoding widget) at rest, on hover, and while
  the mouse button is held down — check in both a light and a dark theme; dark theme hover must
  go **lighter**, not darker

### MT-DIFF

**Diff viewing across file surfaces**

**Code:** `vcs/diff/JujutsuDiffProvider.kt`, `actions/filechange/`, `vcs/annotate/`, `vcs/history/JujutsuHistoryProvider.kt`, `actions/file/OpenInRemoteFromEditorGroup.kt`, `actions/filechange/OpenFileInRemoteGroup.kt`
**Also re-run:** MT-DIFF-PREVIEW; MT-DIFFBASE (a configured diff base changes what `Annotate`
below annotates against); see [Known gaps](#known-gaps) for jj-idea-7d9p/zvzk, which recur across every surface in this section

#### Diffs

- [ ] Show diff for a directory with changed files shows diffs for each file in the directory
- [ ] Show diff for a directory with no changed files does nothing (no crash)
- [ ] Diff for unchanged file shows no changes (before view has same content, shows content as identical)
- [ ] Diff for a single-parent file shows the correct before/current pairing for each change
      type — verify in Project Tool Window, Editors for Current Files, and Editors for
      Historical Versions too, the assertion is identical across all four: modified
      (before=parent, current=selected), deleted (before=parent, current=empty), added
      (before=empty, current=@), renamed (before=@- with previous filepath, current=@)
- [ ] Diff from working copy shows before = parent, current from working copy
- [ ] jj-idea-zmse: right-clicking inside a diff viewer's editor pane shows "Annotate" exactly
      once (not once at top level and again under "Jujutsu")
- [ ] Right-hand diff pane is editable when it contains the working copy, read-only when
      it contains a historical version
- [ ] Binary/image diffs: commit a change that modifies a `.png`, select that commit in the
      log and open the file's diff (and again with a later commit selected, so both sides are
      historical) — IntelliJ's image diff viewer shows both versions as images, not garbled
      text/bytes; an ordinary text file in the same commit still shows a syntax-highlighted
      text diff
- [ ] "Open in -> remote": for a single parent, opens that parent (resolves to pushed
      ancestor); hidden when no pushed ancestor exists; for an unpushed historical version,
      resolves to the nearest pushed ancestor — verify in Working Copy Panel, Project Tool
      Window, Editors for Current Files, and Editors for Historical Versions
- [ ] jj-idea-c4tp: right-click a file (editor or Working Copy panel) to open "Open in Remote"
      immediately after opening the project (first menu open, cold cache) — submenu still lists
      remotes correctly, with no `Synchronous execution under ReadAction` warning in Help → Show
      Log

#### Project Tool Window

- [ ] File in tool window has a Jujutsu menu with "Show Diff" and "Compare with Another Commit..."
- [ ] jj-idea-lo7u: menu also has "Compare Before with Another Commit..." for a historical
      selection; hidden for the working-copy entry and for a root commit
- [ ] Show diff for multiple files opens multiple editors
- [ ] Menu has Open in -> remote (see Diffs above for the single-parent/no-ancestor cases)

#### Editors for Current Files

- [ ] Jujutsu menu has "Show Diff", "Compare with Another Commit", and "Annotate"
- [ ] Annotate fetches annotations for the correct revision
- [ ] "Annotate Previous Revision" on a line owned by a single-parent commit re-annotates at that commit's parent
- [ ] "Annotate Previous Revision" on a line owned by a merge commit is unavailable/no-op (no incorrect ancestor shown)
- [ ] jj-idea-xssw: "Annotate Previous Revision" on a line whose own change added the file (no
      earlier version exists) declines gracefully — no raw error, no logged ReadAction-violation
      warning (`idea.log`/Help → Show Log)
- [ ] Annotate on a file whose working copy is a merge commit succeeds (no "resolved to more than one revision" error)
- [ ] Annotate on a merge commit with a resolved conflict shows no "line count" warning, and correctly attributes lines inherited from each parent plus the conflict-resolution line(s) to the merge commit itself
- [ ] Annotate on a merge commit where the file exists in only some parents (e.g. a criss-cross merge) succeeds (no "No such path" error), attributing blame from whichever parents have the file
- [ ] jj-idea-mn1a: with the IDE on a **light** theme, the change-id column in the annotation
      gutter is readable, not washed-out
- [ ] Has open in -> remote (see Diffs above)

#### Editors for Historical Versions

- [ ] Has title including change id, and a Jujutsu menu with diff and "compare with another commit"
- [ ] Compare with another commit opens that commit on LHS, editor's version on RHS
- [ ] jj-idea-lo7u: Jujutsu menu also has "Compare Before with Another Commit..."; it opens the
      parent of the editor's revision on LHS and the chosen commit on RHS; hidden for the
      working-copy entry and for a root commit
- [ ] jj-idea-hq4d: "Annotate" is enabled (both via right-click and the Jujutsu menu) for a file
      opened from a historical commit — it used to be greyed out
- [ ] Annotate fetches annotations for the correct revision
- [ ] Has open in -> remote (see Diffs above, including the unpushed-historical-version case)

#### File History

- [ ] jj-idea-hq4d: opening a file from the File History panel (right-click a file → "Show File
      History", pick an older revision, open the file) enables "Annotate"; it produces a blame
      gutter for that revision's content
- [ ] Binary/image history: open the platform history tab for a `.png` changed across a few
      commits, and show the diff between two revisions — it renders as an image diff, not
      text
- [ ] jj-idea-qrne: open a file's platform history tab (editor's Jujutsu submenu → "Show
      History") — Date, Author, and Committer columns are populated for every revision, not
      blank
- [ ] jj-idea-a1fh: in that same tab, click the "Commit Time" column header twice — rows
      order chronologically (oldest→newest, then newest→oldest), not alphabetically by
      committer name
- [ ] jj-idea-c2m8 (GitHub #122): delete a tracked file (`rm`) → right-click it alone in the
      Working Copy panel's changed-files tree → **Show File History** is offered and opens
      history for it (it used to be hidden, the same root cause as MT-WORKINGCOPY's Restore
      dialog checks)

### MT-DIFF-PREVIEW

**Diff preview-tab behavior**

**Code:** `ui/common/JujutsuEditorTabDiffPreview.kt`
**Referenced by:** MT-LOG-DETAILS (Details Changes Panel), MT-WORKINGCOPY (Working Copy Panel),
MT-DIFF

This is the canonical diff preview-tab check, deduplicated from the three surfaces above —
verify it once per surface it's referenced from, not three times independently:

- [ ] Double-click file opens diff in a single editor tab (preview tab)
- [ ] Enter on selected file opens the same diff tab
- [ ] Clicking a different file while the diff tab is open swaps its content; tab count stays at 1
- [ ] Single click does nothing if diff tab is not open
- [ ] Single click swaps diff content if diff tab is already open
- [ ] Escape inside the diff tab closes it
- [ ] Cmd/Ctrl+D opens the same diff preview tab (routes through preview when available)
- [ ] F4 still opens the file in a regular editor tab (no "Synchronous execution on EDT" error in IDE log)
- [ ] With the diff tab open and a different (regular) editor tab focused, edit and save that file — the editor stays on it; it does not switch to the diff tab (GitHub #67)
- [ ] jj-idea-q6vn: with the diff tab open on a long file, scrolled away from the top, edit and save a *different* tracked file from outside the IDE (e.g. a terminal) — once the background refresh lands, the diff stays scrolled where it was, it does not jump to the top
- [ ] jj-idea-q6vn / jj-idea-ouul (GitHub #67): with `@` selected and its diff tab open on the working-copy side, the right-hand pane title reads "Current" (not the change id) and is editable; on a long file, scroll well away from the top, then edit and save *that same file* (the one shown in the diff, not a different one) — content updates in place and scroll position is unchanged

### MT-DIFFBASE

**Custom diff base for gutter markers and Annotate (jj-idea-fwea, GitHub #43)**

**Code:** `vcs/diffbase/`, `settings/DiffbaseStrategy.kt`, `settings/JujutsuConfigurable.kt` (Diff Base group + per-repo override), `actions/diffbase/SetDiffbaseAction.kt` (quick action, jj-idea-g1io), `actions/JujutsuMainMenuGroup.kt` (VCS-menu submenu)
**Also re-run:** MT-DIFF (Annotate is the other consumer of the diff base); MT-SETTINGS (the settings group itself); MT-CTXMENU (the quick action's "Pin to Revision..." shares `RevisionSelectorPopup`); MT-WORKINGCOPY (gutter markers); MT-CROSS (multi-repo submenu)

Requires a repo with at least one immutable ancestor and a few mutable commits above it (e.g.
`jj new trunk()` a couple of times) so "latest immutable ancestor" differs visibly from `@-`.

- [ ] Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu → **Diff Base** defaults to "Working copy parent
      (default)" on a fresh install; gutter markers and Annotate behave exactly as before this
      feature existed
- [ ] jj-idea-fwea: the "Working copy parent", "Latest immutable ancestor" and "Previous commit"
      radio buttons show a "(?)" icon after the label — hovering (or focusing) it shows the
      underlying revset (`@-` / `latest(ancestors(@-) & immutable())` /
      `latest(@-- | latest(ancestors(@-) & immutable()))`); the labels themselves stay short, no
      raw revset text visible without hovering
- [ ] Select "Latest immutable ancestor (trunk)", click Apply — without touching the editor,
      every open file's gutter markers expand to the full diff vs trunk (not just vs `@-`)
- [ ] jj-idea-g1io: select "Previous commit (grandparent)", click Apply — gutter markers narrow
      to the last two commits' worth of change. `jj edit` onto a change directly on trunk (no
      mutable grandparent) and re-check — it falls back to trunk, not past it, into immutable
      history
- [ ] Annotate the same file (Jujutsu → Annotate). **Alignment check:** every blame line lines
      up with the correct source line; lines changed anywhere in the stack read as
      unattributed, not shifted onto the wrong line — this is the bug this feature exists to
      prevent (gutter base and Annotate base must never disagree)
- [ ] Select "Custom revset", type `trunk()`, click **Test** — reports success per repo; gutter
      and Annotate match the "Latest immutable ancestor" case above
- [ ] Type an invalid revset (e.g. `zz(`) and click **Test** — the raw jj error wraps instead
      of widening the panel (same pattern as the Log revset's Test button)
- [ ] Type a revset that matches more than one revision (e.g. `heads(mutable())` in a repo with
      concurrent branches) and click **Test** — reports it resolves to N revisions, not one,
      as an error rather than success; Apply is blocked the same way an unresolvable revset is
- [ ] Leaving "Custom revset" selected with an empty field shows a validation error on Apply
- [ ] **Live update with an editor already open** (the scenario this feature exists to get
      right): with a file's Annotate gutter already showing (from a prior "Latest immutable
      ancestor" run), switch the setting back to "Working copy parent" and click Apply —
      *without* closing the editor or manually re-running Annotate, the gutter's blame updates
      in place to the new base and stays correctly aligned (no line showing the wrong change's
      author). Repeat switching between all four strategies with the gutter left open each
      time — each switch is reflected immediately, never requiring a close/reopen to correct
      itself
- [ ] Multi-repo project: set a per-repo override (Repository Settings → the repo's group →
      "Override diff base") on one repo only — confirm only that repo's files use the
      override, in both the gutter and Annotate; the other repo keeps using the project default
- [ ] jj-idea-fwea: with at least one repo (so the "Repository Settings" group renders — the
      automated `JujutsuConfigurablePanelTest` fixture has none and can't cover this), the
      per-repo "Override diff base" combo box shows short strategy names, not the raw revset
      text; a grey comment line below it explains what `@-` and "Latest immutable ancestor"
      resolve to. Opening Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu at its default size shows no
      horizontal scrollbar with this group expanded (see jj-idea-bwdk's width checklist above)
- [ ] Edge cases: a repo with no immutable ancestor falls back to `@-` (no error dialog, no
      crash); an ignored or unversioned file gets no gutter markers and no error; a file opened
      from the log or File History (a historical version) is unaffected; the **Local Changes** /
      **Working copy** panel keeps showing changes vs `@-` regardless of this setting

**Quick action (jj-idea-g1io, GitHub #43)**

The reporter asked for a fast, task-driven way to switch the diff base, in addition to the
settings row above. It writes the same per-repo setting, always as an explicit per-repo override
(even in a single-repo project) — so it and the settings row can never disagree, but also so the
project-level radios in Settings can read "Working copy parent" while a repo's real base is
something else; only the repo's own "Repository Settings" group shows the truth (jj-idea-4tcf
would add a live indicator here).

The popup deliberately splits "pick a revision" into two entries rather than one: **"Custom
revset..."** saves a typed expression (e.g. `trunk()`) verbatim, re-resolved on every future diff
base change, while **"Pin to Revision..."** freezes to whatever concrete commit the picked
bookmark/tag/change resolves to right now. Reusing a single picker for both used to silently
convert a typed expression into a frozen commit id once its own background resolution caught up —
confirm that's no longer possible (below).

- [ ] **VCS main menu** — "Initialise Jujutsu Repository" is a loose top-level entry (via the
      platform's `Vcs.Import` group), same as Git/Mercurial/Subversion's own "init" actions —
      confirm it appears exactly once, not duplicated
- [ ] **VCS main menu → "Jujutsu"** — a submenu (pin icon) containing "Undo `<last action>`" and
      "Set Diff Base", sitting in the **same section as the "Git" submenu** (both are `VcsGlobalGroup`
      entries anchored after the `Vcs.Specific` marker) — with a Git-colocated or separate Git
      project open, confirm "Jujutsu" and "Git" appear adjacent to each other, not in different
      parts of the menu. "Initialise Jujutsu Repository" is deliberately **not** inside this
      submenu, matching Git.Init not being inside Git.Menu either
- [ ] In a project with **no jj repo yet**, the "Jujutsu" submenu is entirely absent (nothing left
      in it needs to be reachable before a repo exists — only "Initialise Jujutsu Repository"
      does, and it has its own placement above); "Initialise Jujutsu Repository" itself stays
      reachable via the VCS menu, the VCS Operations popup, and the tool window's "Create
      Repository" button, same as always
- [ ] "Set Diff Base" opens a popup listing "Working copy parent", "Latest immutable ancestor",
      "Previous commit", "Custom revset...", "Pin to Revision...", and "Configure in Settings..."
      — a checkmark marks the repo's current strategy
- [ ] Pick "Latest immutable ancestor" from the popup — the popup **closes immediately** (not a
      checkbox that stays open), open editors' gutter markers widen to the full diff vs trunk
      right away, and reopening the popup shows the checkmark moved to "Latest immutable
      ancestor", not stuck on the old entry
- [ ] "Custom revset..." with no override yet active opens an input dialog with an empty field;
      type `trunk()`, OK — gutters/Annotate rebase onto trunk; reopening the popup shows a
      trailing "Custom: `trunk()`" row, checked, and Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu shows
      the repo's "Override diff base" row checked with "Custom revset" and `trunk()` **verbatim**
      (not a resolved change id) — re-run this after letting the field sit idle for a couple of
      seconds before confirming, to specifically catch the frozen-commit-id regression this fix
      targets
- [ ] Reopen "Custom revset..." — the dialog is now pre-filled with the active revset (`trunk()`)
- [ ] Type an invalid revset (e.g. `zz(`) into "Custom revset..." — an error dialog appears and
      the diff base is unchanged; type one that resolves to more than one revision (e.g.
      `heads(mutable())`) — a distinct "resolves to N revisions" error, also unchanged
- [ ] "Pin to Revision..." opens the familiar revision picker (search, bookmarks/tags, free-form
      revset) — picking a bookmark rebases the gutters onto its **current** resolved commit; the
      popup then shows "Custom: `<bookmark>`" checked
- [ ] Annotate the file (Jujutsu → Annotate) after each switch — blame lines stay aligned with
      source lines (same alignment check as MT-DIFFBASE's main flow)
- [ ] **Editor context menu** → Jujutsu → "Set Diff Base" reaches the same popup
- [ ] **Multi-repo project**, VCS menu → Jujutsu → "Set Diff Base" with no file/editor in context
      — one submenu per repository (named by repo); setting one repo's base leaves the other
      repo's untouched
- [ ] "Configure in Settings..." opens Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu

### MT-CONFLICT

**Conflict resolution**

**Code:** `jj/conflict/`, `vcs/merge/JujutsuConflictResolver.kt`, `vcs/merge/JujutsuMergeProvider.kt`, `vcs/diff/JujutsuConflictDiffRequestProvider.kt`, `ui/common/JujutsuConflictsNode.kt`, `actions/file/ResolveSelectedConflictsAction.kt`, `actions/file/ResolveAllConflictsAction.kt`, `actions/change/resolveConflictsAction.kt`, `actions/change/resolveConflictsAvailability.kt`
**Fixture:** FX-CONFLICT (content conflicts), FX-MD-CONFLICT (modify/delete conflicts)
**Also re-run:** MT-CROSS (multi-repo scoping); MT-DIFF-PREVIEW, MT-LOG-DETAILS, MT-WORKINGCOPY (`JujutsuConflictDiffRequestProvider` is consumed via the shared preview-tab helper those sections cover)

#### Detection

- [ ] `file.txt` appears in the Working Copy panel with red (MERGED_WITH_CONFLICTS) status
- [ ] All three marker styles (git, snapshot, diff) correctly mark the file as conflicted
- [ ] Under each marker style, "Resolve Conflicts…" shows correctly-oriented, commit-labelled
      panes (see "Rebase conflict pane orientation and titles" below) — not just that the file is
      detected as conflicted

#### Rebase conflict pane orientation and titles (GitHub #112, jj-idea-l192)

A rebase conflict's two sides are asymmetric — one is the commit you rebased onto (jj calls this
the "destination"), the other is your own moved commit — and which one jj renders as full content
vs. a diff from base varies per conflict, not per operation. "Resolve Conflicts…" now reads jj's
own per-side label out of the conflict markers to decide which side is "Yours", instead of
guessing from marker layout.

Set up: `base` → `my change`; separately, `base` → `modified externally`; then rebase `my change`
onto `modified externally` so it conflicts.

- [ ] Opening "Resolve Conflicts…" on the conflicted file shows **your own change on the left**
      pane and **the commit you rebased onto on the right**, titled with jj's own commit +
      description text (e.g. `ulmlywnv "my change" (rebased revision)`), not "Yours"/"Theirs"
- [ ] Repeat with a **descendant** of the rebased commit also conflicted (rebase a small stack,
      not just one commit) — the orientation is the same as above for every conflicted commit in
      the stack, not just the one directly targeted by the rebase
- [ ] Try all three of `ui.conflict-marker-style` (`diff`, `git`, `snapshot`) — orientation and
      titles are correct under `diff` and `git`; under `snapshot` (no commit info in the markers)
      the panes fall back to plain **"Side #1"** / **"Side #2"** titles, content unaffected
- [ ] A **merge** conflict (two arbitrary commits combined, not a rebase) and a **squash**
      conflict still show today's unswapped ordering — confirm neither reads backwards now that
      rebase conflicts do reorient
- [ ] In the platform's native multi-file merge dialog (Commit tool window, if enabled) for the
      same rebase conflict, bulk **"Accept Yours"** and the interactive dialog's left pane resolve
      to the **same content** — confirm with `jj status`/file content after each — and likewise
      for **"Accept Theirs"** and the right pane

#### Modify/delete conflicts (jj-idea-x283)

Uses FX-MD-CONFLICT. Content conflicts (above) resolve to a merged text file either way; a
modify/delete conflict is different — one side deleted the file entirely, so "accept" on that
side must actually remove the file from disk, not leave an empty file behind.

- [ ] `a.txt` appears in the Working Copy panel as MERGED_WITH_CONFLICTS
- [ ] Opening the merge tool (via "Resolve Conflicts…") shows one pane empty (the deleted side)
- [ ] In the platform's native multi-file merge dialog, using its bulk **"Accept Yours"** (or
      **"Accept Theirs"**) button when the chosen side is the deletion **removes `a.txt` from
      disk** — confirm with `jj status` (shows `D a.txt`, no conflict), not an empty `a.txt`
- [ ] Using the jj-idea "Resolve Conflicts…" action's interactive merge tool, saving with an
      empty result pane (i.e. choosing the deleted side) also **deletes `a.txt`** rather than
      writing an empty file — confirm with `jj status`
- [ ] Saving a genuinely edited (non-empty) result through either path still writes that content
      normally
- [ ] Make the repo temporarily unwritable (e.g. `chmod -w .jj/working_copy` on the resolve
      target) and retry accept-yours/theirs from the native dialog: an **error notification**
      appears (no silent no-op)

#### Conflicts grouping node and "Resolve All Conflicts" toolbar button (GitHub #56, jj-idea-uoeg)

A reporter on GitHub #56 declined to use the Working Copy panel because, unlike the standard
Commit tool window's single "Merge Conflicts / Resolve" grouping, it required hunting for red
files one at a time. This adds an equivalent affordance directly to the Working Copy panel.

- [ ] With `file.txt` conflicted, a bold **"Merge Conflicts"** node appears at the **top** of the Working Copy changes tree, above the normal directory/repository grouping, showing a file count and a clickable **"Resolve"** link
- [ ] Clicking the node's "Resolve" link opens the merge tool for every file under that node, one after another
- [ ] Cancelling out of the merge tool from this entry point still **leaves conflict markers intact** (the GitHub #63 invariant — confirm with `jj status` after cancelling)
- [ ] After resolving the only conflicted file, the "Merge Conflicts" node **disappears** on the next automatic refresh, without pressing Refresh (exercises the same jj-idea-3cvb fix as the file-level action)
- [ ] Toggle **Group By → Directory / Repository / None** in the changes-tree toolbar: the "Merge Conflicts" node stays pinned at the top in all three modes, with the chosen grouping nested *inside* it
- [ ] Multi-repo project with conflicts in two jj roots: a single "Merge Conflicts" node contains both roots' conflicted files (grouped by repository underneath, if that grouping is active)
- [ ] Collapse the "Merge Conflicts" node, restart the IDE: it's still collapsed. Then create/resolve a conflict so the file count changes: it's **still collapsed** (the node's persisted collapse-state key must not embed the count)
- [ ] Right-click the "Merge Conflicts" node itself → "Resolve Conflicts…": acts on every conflicted file under it (same as clicking the inline "Resolve" link)
- [ ] The changes-tree toolbar has a **"Resolve All Conflicts…"** button, visible only when the working copy has at least one conflict
- [ ] Select a **non-conflicted** file in the tree, with `file.txt` still conflicted elsewhere: the toolbar button **stays visible and works** (it must not depend on tree selection — this is the specific regression the button's separate action implementation exists to prevent)
- [ ] Clicking the toolbar button resolves every conflicted file in the working copy, same as the node's link
- [ ] With no conflicts at all: neither the "Merge Conflicts" node nor the toolbar button appear
- [ ] Mixed jj + Git project: the node contains only jj conflicts, never Git-tracked conflicts from a co-located Git root

#### Per-file resolve gestures in the Merge Conflicts node (GitHub #66, jj-idea-wk7p)

GitHub #66: multi-selecting several conflicted files and choosing "Resolve Conflicts…" puts them
in an unspecified queue order with no way to pick where to start or skip ahead. These gestures let
a user pick exactly which file(s) to act on instead.

- [ ] Create at least 3 conflicted files, including one **modify/delete** conflict (see the
      "Modify/delete conflicts" section above for how to set one up). Each row in the "Merge
      Conflicts" node shows jj's own shape text after the file name (e.g. "2-sided conflict" /
      "2-sided conflict including 1 deletion"), matching `jj resolve --list` verbatim
- [ ] **Double-click** one conflicted row (not multi-selected): only that file's merge tool opens,
      not a queue over the whole node
- [ ] Double-click a **non-conflicted** row elsewhere in the tree: unaffected, still opens the
      normal diff preview
- [ ] Select a **single** conflicted row, right-click: the two accept actions read **"Accept
      &lt;jj's own commit label&gt;"** for each side (matching the label the editor banner's
      "Accept …" links show for the same file, GitHub #112) — not "Accept Yours"/"Accept Theirs"
- [ ] Select **two or more** conflicted files from the **same rebase/merge operation**
      (ctrl/cmd-click), right-click: the two actions read the **shared full commit label**
      verbatim (same text as the single-file case, since every selected file names the same
      commit), not the generic "Side #1"/"Side #2"
- [ ] Select conflicted files from **unrelated** conflicts (different commits, even if they'd
      share the same role word, e.g. two unconnected rebases both saying "(rebased revision)"),
      right-click: falls back to the generic **"Accept Side #1"** / **"Accept Side #2"** rather
      than coercing them under one label — never "Yours"/"Theirs" at any tier
- [ ] Reproduce a conflict shaped like `ConflictMarkerFixtures.diffFromNamesADistinctSide`
      (a diff-style side whose own label collides with the `+++++++` side's, e.g. via a divergent
      commit) on a **single** file: the editor banner's two "Accept …" links show **different**
      text — the diff side falls back to jj's `"from:"` identity, and the `+++++++` side still
      shows **its own true jj label** (not a generic fallback: its label was never actually
      unreliable, only the diff side's was) — same for the two context-menu accept actions on
      that one file
- [ ] Reproduce the **same** `diffFromNamesADistinctSide` shape in **two different files** and
      select both: the two context-menu accept actions resolve exactly as in the single-file case
      above (one shows the `"from:"` identity, the other its own true label) — not the generic
      "Side #1"/"Side #2" just because more than one file is selected
- [ ] Select one `diffFromNamesADistinctSide`-shaped file **together with** a
      `ConflictMarkerFixtures.cleanRebaseConflictNamingSameCommits`-shaped file (a *clean* rebase
      conflict naming the same two commits, but with no collision of its own, and in *swapped*
      current/last order relative to the first file): **both** accept actions fall back to the
      generic **"Accept Side #1"** / **"Accept Side #2"** together — even though CURRENT alone
      could resolve to a specific label, LAST cannot (the two files disagree there), and showing
      one specific label alongside one generic one would itself be confusing (`jj-idea-0k7k` tracks
      detecting this "same two commits, swapped" case properly instead of falling back)
- [ ] Invoke either accept action on a multi-selection: all selected files resolve to that side in
      one step, no merge tool opens, no queue order to contend with
- [ ] Run either accept action on a selection that includes the **modify/delete** file: if the
      deleted side is the one accepted, the file is actually **deleted** (`jj status`), not left
      behind empty
- [ ] After either bulk accept, the "Merge Conflicts" node's count drops and resolved rows
      disappear without pressing Refresh
- [ ] Select a mix of conflicted and non-conflicted files: the accept actions act only on the
      conflicted ones
- [ ] With nothing selected, or only non-conflicted files selected: the accept actions don't
      appear in the context menu
- [ ] In the log's commit details pane for a **non-`@`** conflicted commit: no shape text is
      required to work correctly, but double-clicking a conflicted row there still opens the
      (read-only) diff preview, not the merge tool — resolving off `@` is out of scope here (see
      jj-idea-cmc3)

#### "Resolve Conflicts" context menu action (selection-scoped)

There is a single `Jujutsu.ResolveSelectedConflicts` action behind "Resolve Conflicts…";
it's wired into both the Working Copy panel / commit details pane's file context menu and
the Project view / editor "Jujutsu" submenu. It always resolves an explicit selection when
there is one, and otherwise falls back to the single focused file (editor/project view) or
every conflicted file inherited from the working copy's ancestors (see "Inherited conflicts"
below) — there is no separate "resolve every conflicted file regardless of context" action at
the file level (for that, see "Log row context menu" further down, which resolves every
conflicted file reachable from the working copy).

- [ ] Right-clicking a **non-conflicted** file in the Working Copy panel: "Resolve Conflicts…" is **not visible**, even when other, unrelated files elsewhere in the repo are conflicted
- [ ] Right-clicking `file.txt` (conflicted): "Resolve Conflicts…" **is visible**
- [ ] Invoking it opens the merge tool for **only** `file.txt`, not unrelated files
- [ ] Multi-select: selecting one conflicted + one non-conflicted file → only the conflicted file's merge tool opens
- [ ] Multi-select: selecting two conflicted files → both open in turn (second opens after the first is resolved)
- [ ] Multi-select: selecting two **non-conflicted** files (with some other file elsewhere in the repo conflicted): "Resolve Conflicts…" is **not visible**
- [ ] Right-clicking a **directory**, or the project root, in the Project view → Jujutsu submenu: "Resolve Conflicts…" is **not present** (no single file in scope to act on — there is no "resolve every conflicted file in the project" entry point at the file/project-view level; use the log row context menu for that, see below)
- [ ] Right-clicking `file.txt` itself in the Project view → Jujutsu → Resolve Conflicts…: opens the merge tool for `file.txt`
- [ ] Opening `file.txt` in the editor, right-clicking → Jujutsu → Resolve Conflicts…: opens the merge tool for **only** `file.txt` (scoped to the focused editor file, not every conflicted file)
- [ ] **On IntelliJ/RustRover 2026.2 (build 262) specifically**: triggering "Resolve Conflicts…" opens the merge tool at all (jj-idea-qfgl / GitHub #55 — this used to silently do nothing)

#### Three-way merge tool — content correctness

- [ ] Left pane ("Yours") shows "ours" content (`changed by A`, the rebased change)
- [ ] Right pane ("Theirs") shows "theirs" content (`changed by B`, the destination)
- [ ] Center pane is editable; initially shows a proposed merge result (not identical to left or right)
- [ ] Left and right panes are **not** identical — conflict regions are highlighted
- [ ] Works correctly for all three marker styles (git, snapshot, diff)

#### Resolving via the merge tool

- [ ] Edit the center pane to a desired resolution and click Apply Changes
- [ ] After closing the tool, `file.txt` content on disk reflects the resolution (no conflict markers)
- [ ] `file.txt` disappears from the Working Copy panel's conflict list **automatically**, without pressing Refresh (jj-idea-3cvb: a stale conflict decoration used to survive even a manual Refresh)
- [ ] Right-clicking `file.txt` again (now resolved): "Resolve Conflicts…" is **not visible**, and if triggered anyway does not throw

#### Editor notification banner (jj-idea-aunm, GitHub #56; live count + accept actions, jj-idea-lkrt)

Since jj-idea-lkrt, the static "This file has merge conflicts [Resolve]" banner is a
model-accurate one: a live block count parsed from the editor document (not just
`ChangeListManager`'s status), an **"Accept &lt;side label&gt;"** link per side using jj's own
commit+role labels (GitHub #112), and a secondary **"Open Merge Tool"** link for the existing
three-way merge tool. Both the heading and the side labels are kept deliberately short (a
narrow editor split can't fit jj's full marker-header text plus three links on one line) - the
full, untruncated side label and the "edit the markers directly" hint are both available as
tooltips.

- [ ] Open `file.txt` (2 conflict blocks) in the editor: a warning-colored banner appears at the
      top with text "2 conflicts remaining:", an **"Accept &lt;side-1 label&gt;"** link, an
      **"Accept &lt;side-2 label&gt;"** link, and an **"Open Merge Tool"** link
- [ ] Hovering the banner's text shows a tooltip explaining that hand-editing the markers and
      saving also works
- [ ] Under `ui.conflict-marker-style = "git"` or `"diff"` with a rebase conflict, the accept
      links read jj's own commit+description labels (e.g. `Accept ulmlywnv "my change" (re…`),
      matching "Resolve Conflicts…"'s pane titles for the same file (see "Rebase conflict pane
      orientation and titles" above)
- [ ] With a long jj label (long description text, or the role-annotated rebase-conflict case
      above), the accept link's text is **truncated with an ellipsis** rather than overflowing
      the editor width - narrow the editor split to confirm the banner never wraps or gets
      clipped by the platform itself; hovering the truncated link's tooltip shows the **full**
      untruncated label
- [ ] Under `ui.conflict-marker-style = "snapshot"` (no commit info in the markers), the accept
      links fall back to **"Accept Side #1"** / **"Accept Side #2"** (short enough to never need
      truncating)
- [ ] Hand-edit one block's markers away (leaving one block remaining) and save: within ~1s
      (no need to switch tabs or press Refresh) the banner text updates to "1 conflict
      remaining:" — singular, count decremented
- [ ] Hand-edit the last block's markers away: the banner **disappears** on its own, before any
      jj snapshot happens (i.e. even before saving triggers a `jj status` refresh)
- [ ] Undo the hand-edits so the file is back to 2 conflict blocks; click **"Accept &lt;side-1
      label&gt;"**: `file.txt` on disk gets side #1's content with no markers, `jj status` shows
      it resolved, and the banner disappears **without a manual Refresh**
- [ ] Repeat, clicking **"Accept &lt;side-2 label&gt;"** on a freshly-conflicted file: resolves
      to side #2's content instead
- [ ] FX-MD-CONFLICT: clicking **Accept** on the side that is a deletion **removes the file**
      from disk (`jj status` shows `D`), not an empty file — same invariant as the bulk
      accept-yours/theirs path below
- [ ] Clicking **"Open Merge Tool"** opens the same three-way merge tool as the other entry
      points
- [ ] Cancelling out of the merge tool from this entry point still **leaves conflict markers
      intact** (the GitHub #63 invariant)
- [ ] After resolving `file.txt` via any accept link, the merge tool, or any other entry point
      while the file is open in the editor, the banner **disappears automatically**, without
      switching tabs or reopening the file
- [ ] Open a **non-conflicted** jj-tracked file: no banner appears
- [ ] Mixed jj + Git project: opening a file with a **Git** conflict shows no jj banner (and vice versa)
- [ ] Open a conflicted file that is **outside** any jj repo (e.g. an unrelated Git-only root in a multi-root project): no jj banner appears

#### Cancelling must never discard a side (GitHub #63 — critical regression check)

- [ ] Open the merge tool for `file.txt` and close it via the window's `x` button **without** touching anything: `file.txt` **stays conflicted** — content on disk still has its original conflict markers, and it still shows red (MERGED_WITH_CONFLICTS) in the Working Copy panel
- [ ] Same, but click the **Cancel** button instead of `x`: same result — file stays fully conflicted
- [ ] Resolve only *some* of the conflict's hunks in the center pane, then close via `x` (don't click Apply): `file.txt` **stays fully conflicted** on disk (no partial write, original markers intact) — not partially resolved, not resolved-by-discarding
- [ ] Repeat all three checks above for each marker style (git, snapshot, diff)
- [ ] Multi-file: with two conflicted files, cancel the merge tool for the first → the second file's merge tool **never opens** and remains conflicted untouched

The native Commit tool window's own "Resolve" link is a known gap for this invariant — see
jj-idea-ddcd in [Known gaps](#known-gaps).

#### Accept Yours / Accept Theirs (in the merge tool)

- [ ] In the three-way merge tool, click **Accept Left** (yours): `file.txt` on disk contains "ours" content with no conflict markers
- [ ] `file.txt` leaves conflicted state automatically, without pressing Refresh
- [ ] **Accept Right** (theirs) analogously writes "theirs" content

#### Log details pane (commit selected in log table)

Use the same conflict setup above. The test repo has a conflicted commit that is **not** the working copy (e.g., run `jj new` to create an empty working copy on top of the conflicted change).

- [ ] Selecting the **conflicted historical commit** in the log: conflicted file appears in the details panel with red (MERGED_WITH_CONFLICTS) status
- [ ] Selecting the **conflicted historical commit**: "Resolve Conflicts… (edit this change first)" is **visible but disabled** in the details panel context menu (jj-idea-sm1s: resolution requires this commit to become the working copy first)
- [ ] Selecting the **working copy commit** (empty, inherits conflict): "Resolve Conflicts…" **is visible and enabled** in the details panel context menu and opens the merge tool for the inherited conflicted files

#### Conflict diff for a non-working-copy commit (GitHub #119, jj-idea-ct7e)

Use FX-CONFLICT with `wc-position=sibling` (`scripts/fixtures/fx-conflict.sh /tmp/fx-conflict git sibling`)
so `@` is `change-b`, a clean commit unrelated to the conflict on `change-a` — the position the
report was filed from.

- [ ] Select `change-a` in the log; double-click `file.txt` in the details panel → a **three-pane**
      diff opens showing change A's own conflict, titled with jj's commit labels where available
      (not "Yours"/"Theirs", not an error balloon reading "Could not extract conflict data")
- [ ] Left and right panes are **not** identical and match `jj file show -r change-a file.txt`'s
      markers, not the (unrelated) working copy content
- [ ] Re-run the fixture with `wc-position=conflicted` (`@` = `change-a` itself): same three panes,
      unchanged from before this fix
- [ ] From the `conflicted` state, run `jj new change-a` so `@` inherits the conflict as an empty
      child, then open `change-a`'s diff from the log → still shows change A's own conflict
- [ ] With `@` on `change-a` (`conflicted` mode), additionally give the working copy its own,
      different conflict on the same path (e.g. `jj new`, rebase something else onto `@-` to
      conflict `file.txt` again), then open `change-a`'s diff from the log → shows **change A's**
      sides, not `@`'s
- [ ] Working Copy panel: double-click a file conflicted in `@` itself → three panes as before
      (this surface is unaffected — it was already correct)
- [ ] Repeat the first bullet under all three `ui.conflict-marker-style` values (`git`, `snapshot`,
      `diff`); under `snapshot` the panes fall back to plain **"Side #1"**/**"Side #2"** titles
      (see the marker-style bullet under "Rebase conflict pane orientation and titles" above),
      content still correct
- [ ] Scroll a conflicted file's diff, let the log auto-refresh (~300ms debounce): the scroll
      position is **not** reset (the diff-request cache identity this relies on is the same one
      jj-idea-q6vn fixed for ordinary diffs)
- [ ] "Resolve Conflicts…" on `change-a` from this state is still visible-but-disabled (unaffected
      — resolution remains working-copy-only, see "Log row context menu" below)

#### Log row context menu

- [ ] Right-clicking the **working copy entry** when conflicts exist: "Resolve Conflicts…" appears in the context menu, enabled
- [ ] Right-clicking the **working copy entry** when no conflicts exist: "Resolve Conflicts…" is **not visible** (hidden, not just disabled)
- [ ] Right-clicking a **non-conflicted, non-working-copy entry**: "Resolve Conflicts…" is **not visible**
- [ ] Right-clicking a **conflicted, non-working-copy entry** (jj-idea-sm1s — e.g. a merge commit, or a child that only *inherits* the conflict): "Resolve Conflicts… (edit this change first)" is **visible but disabled**, with a tooltip/description prompting the user to `jj edit` the change first
- [ ] Invoking "Resolve Conflicts…" from the log row context menu opens the merge tool for all conflicted files, one after another

#### Inherited conflicts (jj-idea-sm1s)

Extend the setup above: with the working copy on the conflicted commit, run `jj new` to create an empty child (the child now inherits the parent's unresolved conflict).

- [ ] Selecting the **conflicted merge/parent commit** in the log: "Resolve Conflicts… (edit this change first)" is visible but disabled (it is no longer the working copy)
- [ ] Selecting the **child commit** (working copy, inherits the conflict, empty diff of its own): "Resolve Conflicts…" is visible and **enabled**, and resolves the inherited conflict correctly
- [ ] `jj edit` back onto the conflicted parent commit: it becomes the working copy and "Resolve Conflicts…" becomes enabled for it; the previously-child commit (now not the working copy) shows the disabled hint instead

#### Multi-repo scoping

In a project with two jj roots each having conflicts:

- [ ] Right-clicking a conflicted file in root A's Working Copy panel → merge tool opens only for root A's conflicts
- [ ] Right-clicking a conflicted file in root B's → merge tool opens only for root B's conflicts
- [ ] Global action (VCS menu) → merge tool opens for conflicts from both roots, one after another

### MT-IGNORE

**.gitignore file status and file tracking**

**Code:** `vcs/ignore/GitignoreCache.kt`, `vcs/ignore/JujutsuIgnoreService.kt`, `vcs/ignore/JujutsuIgnoredFilesService.kt`, `vcs/ignore/JujutsuTrackedFilesService.kt`, `vcs/changes/JujutsuIgnoredFileProvider.kt`, `actions/file/TrackedToggleAction.kt`, `actions/file/trackUntrackAvailability.kt`

**Setup**: open this project itself in `./gradlew runIde` — it has a `.gitignore` with `build/`, `.gradle/`, etc.

#### Project Tool Window — ignored file coloring

- [ ] `build/` and `.gradle/` show grayed-out (IGNORED) color in the Project tree, including
      nested files (e.g. `build/classes/Main.class` — parent propagation); `src/` and tracked
      source files are NOT grayed out

→ automate: jj-idea-aah2 (.gitignore coloring/propagation checks above are file-classification
logic, testable without rendering)

#### Local Changes — Ignored Files node

- [ ] Version Control → Local Changes shows an "Ignored Files" group
- [ ] `build/` and its contents appear under "Ignored Files"
- [ ] Tracked modified files (e.g. a file you just edited) do NOT appear under "Ignored Files"; they appear as changes

#### Reactive update on .gitignore edit

Note: order matters — jj auto-tracks files created before the matching gitignore rule exists,
so adding a file to .gitignore after it's already tracked will not untrack it (same as git).

- [ ] Add `*.xyz` to `.gitignore` and save first
- [ ] Then create a new file `test-ignored.xyz` in the repo root
- [ ] It should appear gray (IGNORED color) in the Project tree immediately (jj did not auto-track it)
- [ ] Remove `*.xyz` from `.gitignore` and save → `test-ignored.xyz` turns unversioned color (green/teal)
- [ ] Delete `test-ignored.xyz` when done

#### Tracked files not wrongly ignored

- [ ] Edit a tracked file (e.g. `CHANGELOG.md`) — it should remain non-gray and appear in working copy changes
- [ ] Even if `.gitignore` contained a pattern matching `CHANGELOG.md`, a tracked file would not be
      grayed (not independently verifiable in the IDE — tracked files are never passed to the
      ignore check in the first place; this is a code-level invariant, not a UI behavior to click through)

#### Ignore-scan watchdog (jj-idea-la8w)

The watchdog (5s) aborts the in-progress full ignore-scan instead of merely logging. This is
mostly covered by `GitignoreScanTest.kt` (code-level scale test); the disable escape hatch
remains manually verifiable:

- [ ] Settings / Version Control / Jujutsu → per-repo "disable ignored-file scanning" checkbox
      still works: enable it, edit `.gitignore`, confirm the Ignored Files node stops updating
- [ ] If you have access to a very large repo: a slow scan should show the "ignore scan slow"
      notification once per repo per session, with "disable" and "report" actions still
      functioning; the IDE should not hang waiting for the scan to finish after the watchdog
      fires
- [ ] jj-idea-ixju: global "disable ignored-file scanning (all repositories)" default and its
      interaction with the per-repo override — see the batch-2 checklist under MT-SETTINGS

#### Large ignored-file set cap (jj-idea-cvqz)

→ automate: jj-idea-s0ab (the cap itself only needs a large synthetic ignored-file set,
not a real >50k-entry repo)

Ignored files are reported via `ChangelistBuilder.processIgnoredFile` inside the CLM refresh
(same cycle as change detection). The async scan still runs off the refresh thread; `getChanges`
reads the cached set. A `IGNORE_REPORT_CAP` (50,000 entries) limits the number of
`processIgnoredFile` calls per refresh. If the cached set exceeds the cap, a one-shot
"Jujutsu Ignored-File List Is Very Large" notification appears with a "disable scanning" action.

- [ ] Open a repo with ignored files — they appear under "Ignored Files" in Local Changes
- [ ] Ignored files still update after editing `.gitignore` (the async rescan triggers a CLM
      refresh, which calls `getChanges` again and picks up the updated set)
- [ ] If you have access to a repo with >50,000 ignored top-level entries: the notification
      fires once; "disable scanning" action disables the setting and the Ignored Files node
      becomes empty

#### Tracked toggle (jj-idea-i9ol, GitHub #42)

Right-click on selected files in Project view, editor, Working Copy panel, or a Commit view → a
single **Tracked** checkbox item (wrapping `jj file track --include-ignored` / `jj file untrack`)
appears when at least one selected file matches an ignore rule. Checked means jj currently tracks
the file; unchecked means it doesn't; clicking flips it. Unlike an earlier build of this feature,
there's no separate Track/Untrack pair and no text hint about which one might fail — tracked
status is always determined reliably via `jj file list` (see
`docs/jj-track-untrack-model.md`), never guessed. The item is hidden entirely on ordinary,
non-ignored files (there's nothing meaningful to toggle there), on **any selection containing a
folder** (no tri-state checkbox exists in IntelliJ's menu system, and folders are out of scope for
this feature — see jj-idea-i9ol's design notes), and in the Commit details panel (historical,
non-working-copy context — tracking only applies to the working copy).

Tracked status is resolved via a small async cache (`JujutsuTrackedFilesService`) rather than a
direct query, since `update()`/`isSelected()` run under a read action even on background threads
and IntelliJ forbids blocking subprocess calls there. **The first time you right-click a
previously-unseen file *without clicking the checkbox*, it may briefly show unchecked (a safe
default) while the cache populates in the background (~300ms)** — right-clicking (or looking)
again shortly after should show the accurate state. This is expected, not a bug. Once you actually
**click** the checkbox, its state is written immediately and is authoritative from that point on —
no such delay applies to a click.

→ automate: jj-idea-me8m (tracked-toggle cache semantics below are async-cache state logic,
testable without rendering)

- [ ] Add a pattern to `.gitignore`, create a matching file that was never tracked. Right-click it
      in Project view, Working Copy panel, and a Commit view → **Tracked** checkbox appears,
      unchecked
- [ ] Check it → the checkbox flips to **checked immediately and stays checked** (right-click the
      same file again right after — still checked; this is the regression check for an earlier
      build where the checkbox could silently revert because `isSelected()` re-read a
      not-yet-updated cache). A brief progress indicator appears in the status bar while the
      command runs, and a notification balloon confirms completion ("Track — 'foo.txt'"). The file
      now actually appears in the working copy / `jj file list` (regression check: an even earlier
      build's Track action silently no-op'd on ignored files because it was missing
      `--include-ignored`); log refreshes
- [ ] Uncheck it → checkbox flips to unchecked immediately; notification balloon reads
      "Untrack — 'foo.txt'"; file becomes untracked again
- [ ] Multi-select one already-tracked-and-ignored file plus one untracked-and-ignored file →
      checkbox shows **unchecked** (mixed selection reads as "something left to track"); checking
      it tracks only the untracked one (notification summarizes the count, e.g. "Track — 1 file"),
      leaving the already-tracked one alone
- [ ] Untrack (uncheck) a file, then immediately try unchecking an already-untracked one in the
      same multi-select → the notification balloon's message includes jj's own
      `Warning: No matching entries for paths: ...` text for the no-op member (regression check:
      an earlier build silently swallowed this warning entirely)
- [ ] Force a failure — e.g. manually remove a file from `.gitignore` so it's no longer ignored,
      then try unchecking it anyway → a **non-blocking error notification** balloon appears (not a
      modal dialog) showing jj's "not ignored" message, and the checkbox **reverts** to its true
      (checked) state rather than staying on the failed change
- [ ] Right-click a normal, non-ignored, tracked file (anywhere: Project view, editor, Working
      Copy panel, Commit view) → **no Tracked checkbox appears at all**
- [ ] Right-click a file in the **Commit details panel** (historical, non-working-copy context)
      → no Tracked checkbox appears, even on an ignored file
- [ ] Right-click a **directory** that itself matches an ignore rule (e.g. `build/`) → no Tracked
      checkbox appears, in Project view and Working Copy panel alike. Also check a mixed selection
      (one file + one directory) → checkbox likewise hidden (regression check: an earlier build
      would have shown a permanently-inert checkbox for a directory selection)
- [ ] Right-click an ignored file you've never interacted with before → confirm no
      `Synchronous execution under ReadAction` (or similar) error appears in the IDE log
      (Help → Show Log) — this was a real crash in an earlier build, caused by querying
      `jj file list` directly inside the checkbox's `update()`/`isSelected()`

### MT-GIT

**Git push / fetch dialogs**

**Code:** `actions/git/GitPushDialog.kt`, `actions/git/GitPushAction.kt`, `actions/git/gitRemoteActions.kt`, `actions/git/GitFetchDialog.kt`, `actions/git/GitFetchAction.kt`, `actions/git/RadioScopeBinding.kt`

#### Git Push Dialog

Setup: have a local bookmark that has never been pushed to the remote.

- [ ] Open push dialog (VCS menu → Push) → "Tracking bookmarks (default)" selected → OK → push completes (shows success notification)
- [ ] Open push dialog → "Tracking bookmarks (default)" → if new bookmark exists, confirmation dialog appears asking whether to create remote bookmark → confirm → push succeeds
- [ ] Open push dialog → "Specific bookmark" → select an untracked bookmark → OK → push succeeds
- [ ] Open push dialog → "All bookmarks" → OK → pushes all bookmarks
- [ ] Cancel push dialog → no push occurs
- [ ] The scope radio group (Default / Specific bookmark / All bookmarks) has the correct
  option selected by default when the dialog opens, the bookmark combo box enables only when
  "Specific bookmark" is selected, and clicking between all three options multiple times before
  OK always pushes according to the last-selected option (scope selection is hand-wired via
  action listeners, not the platform's declarative binding, as of the 2026.2 platform-compat
  work — jj-idea-gu9q)
- [ ] (jj-idea-idm0) With a repository that has 2+ Git remotes: open the push dialog, switch the
  **Remote** combo to a different remote — the bookmark combo must immediately show a real
  bookmark (never blank), select "Specific bookmark" → OK → dialog closes and pushes to the
  newly selected remote/bookmark. Repeat switching remotes several times before pressing OK.
  Check Help → Show Log afterwards for any `NullPointerException` from `GitPushDialog` — there
  must be none (previously the Push button appeared completely inert after a remote switch)
- [ ] Push a bookmark that's already up to date with the remote → the notification shows jj's
  own "Nothing changed." message rather than a bare "Push complete"
- [ ] Every bookmark tracked against the selected remote appears **exactly once** in the
  "Specific bookmark" dropdown — none of them also shows a duplicate "(new)" entry
  (jj-idea-ehki — `GitPushDialog.currentBookmarks()`/`mergeBookmarks` used to dedupe by full
  `Bookmark` equality, which never matched because `tracked` differs between the two source
  lists)
- [ ] (jj-idea-ehki) Delete a local bookmark that's still tracked on the remote
  (`jj bookmark delete <name>`) so it's a pending deletion. Right-click the **commit** it used
  to sit on in the log (not the bookmark chip) → Push… → "Specific bookmark" → the dropdown
  must include `<name> (deleted)` in grey italic, even though the push was opened scoped to
  that revision. Select it → OK → the "will be deleted from the remote" confirmation appears →
  confirm → push succeeds and the bookmark disappears from the remote (`jj bookmark list
  --all-remotes` shows it gone, not just `(deleted)` locally)

#### `--change` push scope (jj-idea-fmzr, GitHub #65; multi-select/toolbar jj-idea-ikof)

A fourth scope, "Create bookmark for change \<id\>", runs `jj git push --change <rev>` —
auto-generating a `push-<change-id>`-style remote bookmark for the target revision, per jj's own
recommended workflow. The dialog resolves the target itself; there's no revision picker in the
dialog. Available from three entry points — the toolbar/VCS-menu Push button (`GitPushAction`),
the log's right-click Push (`gitPushAction()`), and the per-bookmark Push submenu (which never
offers this scope — it's always "Specific bookmark") — and reads the **log table's current
selection** wherever one exists.

- [ ] Toolbar Push (VCS menu icon or log toolbar button) with **nothing selected in the log** (or
  invoked from a context with no log at all) → the fourth radio names `@`'s own change id (or
  `@-` if `@` is empty — see below) → OK → a new `push-<id>` bookmark appears on the remote
  (`jj bookmark list --all-remotes`)
- [ ] Select a **single commit** in the log, then click the toolbar Push button → the fourth
  radio names that commit's own change id, not `@` — confirms the toolbar button now reads the
  log selection (previously it always ignored it)
- [ ] `jj commit` so `@` is empty, then toolbar Push with nothing selected → the fourth radio now
  names `@-`'s change id instead
- [ ] Right-click a **specific commit** in the log → Push… → the fourth radio names that
  commit's own change id, regardless of where `@` currently is
- [ ] **Multi-select** several commits in one repo, then either right-click → Push… or the
  toolbar Push button → the fourth radio reads "Create bookmarks for N changes" (plural) → OK →
  one `push-<id>` bookmark per selected commit appears on the remote, all in one confirmation
- [ ] **Multi-repo project**: select commits spanning two different repos, then toolbar Push →
  dialog opens normally, but the fourth radio is **absent** (not just disabled) — the other
  three scopes work as usual via the dialog's own Repository selector
- [ ] Still with that cross-repo selection: right-click → Push… (context menu) is **entirely
  disabled** — unchanged from before this scope existed, since the context menu's Push has
  always required a single repo
- [ ] With a single-repo selection and the fourth radio chosen, switch the dialog's own
  **Repository** combo to a different repo → the fourth radio disappears and the scope silently
  reverts to "Tracking bookmarks (default)" — no crash, no stale target left selected
- [ ] Push the same change twice via this scope → the second push does not create a second
  `push-*` bookmark (confirm via `jj bookmark list --all-remotes` — same bookmark name both
  times)
- [ ] This scope's dry-run does **not** spuriously trigger the "will create a new remote
  bookmark" confirmation that the default/tracking scope shows (jj only refuses new remote
  bookmarks for that scope, not `--change`)

#### Git Fetch Dialog

Setup: a repository with 2+ remotes (the scope radio group only appears in this case).

- [ ] Open fetch dialog (VCS menu → Fetch) → "Specific remote" selected by default, remote combo
  box enabled → OK → fetches from the selected remote
- [ ] Switch to "All remotes" → remote combo box disables → OK → fetches from every remote
- [ ] Switch back to "Specific remote" → combo box re-enables with the previously selected remote
  → OK → fetches just that one
- [ ] Cancel fetch dialog → no fetch occurs
- [ ] (jj-idea-idm0) With 2+ repositories mapped, and the repository selector visible: switch the
  **Repository** combo to a different repo — the remote combo must immediately show a real
  remote for that repo (never blank) → OK → fetches from the newly selected repo/remote

#### New/untracked bookmark push (jj-idea-dt2k, GitHub #53)

The plugin no longer uses `jj git push --allow-new` (removed in jj 0.42.0); it tracks the
bookmark against the remote first, then pushes without any special flag. Verify on **both**
jj < 0.42 (e.g. 0.37–0.41) and jj ≥ 0.42 (e.g. 0.43) — this was the #53 regression, previously
failing on 0.42+ with `error: unexpected argument '--allow-new'`:

- [ ] "Tracking bookmarks (default)" scope with a brand-new untracked bookmark at the working
  copy → confirmation dialog lists the bookmark → confirm → push succeeds and the bookmark is
  now tracked (`jj bookmark list` shows `@origin`)
- [ ] "Specific bookmark" scope, selecting an untracked bookmark → same confirmation → confirm →
  push succeeds
- [ ] Cancel either confirmation dialog → no push occurs, bookmark remains untracked

### MT-SETTINGS

**Settings panel**

**Code:** `settings/JujutsuConfigurable.kt`, `settings/JujutsuSettings.kt`, `settings/JujutsuSettingsState.kt`, `settings/JujutsuApplicationSettings.kt`
**Also re-run:** MT-DIFFBASE (its Diff Base group and per-repo override live in this same panel); MT-DND (its Preview features group is checked there too)

- [ ] JJ executable path can be configured, including via the file picker
- [ ] Auto-refresh toggle, change ID format preference (short/long), and log change limit
      each take effect as expected, and all settings persist across IDE restarts
- [ ] (jj-idea-ye1x) In a **multi-repo** project, expand a repo's "Repository Settings" group and
      turn on "Override diff base for this repository" with "Custom revset" selected — no
      horizontal scrollbar appears on the settings panel
- [ ] (jj-idea-i7fa) With a healthy, up-to-date jj configured, expand "Installation Help" —
      wording reads as a neutral "up to date, update later with:" (not "if jj is not
      installed…"), and the command rows show update commands (e.g. `brew upgrade jj`), not
      install commands
- [ ] (jj-idea-i7fa) With Settings still open, change the "JJ executable path:" field to an
      older jj or a bogus path (e.g. `/bin/ls`) and click **Test**, without clicking Apply —
      Installation Help's wording, gated-feature list, and command rows update in place to
      preview the just-tested path immediately, before it's saved
- [ ] (jj-idea-i7fa) Now click **Apply** on that same changed path — Installation Help still
      reflects it (no flicker back to the previous path's wording), and other jj-availability
      consumers (e.g. the Working Copy tool window) pick up the change too
- [ ] (jj-idea-bslw, real fix in jj-idea-258c) Expand "Installation Help" — "Homebrew:"/"Cargo:"
      (or whichever methods are detected) have a comfortable, clearly visible gap before their
      command box, not sitting close to it. (jj-idea-bslw's first attempt — a Border on the
      label — measured fine in a unit test but was invisible on screen: the DSL's grid absorbs a
      component's own border into its layout math instead of pushing the next cell over.
      jj-idea-258c's `.gap(RightGap.COLUMNS)` is the real inter-cell gap and is what to expect
      here.)
- [ ] Narrow the Settings window/pane as much as the IDE allows — nothing should need horizontal
      scrolling to stay fully visible: the "JJ executable path:" row's field + Test button, and
      Installation Help's command rows + Copy buttons

#### Default push scope (jj-idea-fmzr, jj-idea-ikof)

- [ ] **General** section: a "Default push scope:" combo lists all four Push dialog scopes
      (Tracking bookmarks / Specific bookmark / All bookmarks / Create bookmark for change).
      Defaults to "Tracking bookmarks (default)" on a fresh install.
- [ ] Set it to "Create bookmark for change", click Apply, then open Push from **both** the log's
      right-click menu and the toolbar/VCS-menu button — both open with the fourth radio already
      selected (the toolbar button didn't honor this setting at all before jj-idea-ikof; confirm
      it does now). Restart the IDE — the setting persists.
- [ ] With the default set to "Create bookmark for change", right-click a **bookmark** →
      Push… (the per-bookmark entry point, jj-idea-t29z) still opens on "Specific bookmark" —
      this setting only affects the dialog's *unforced* default, not a caller that already
      knows which bookmark it wants
- [ ] With the default set to "Create bookmark for change" and a cross-repo log selection: open
      toolbar Push → the fourth scope is unavailable (see MT-GIT), so the dialog falls back to
      "Tracking bookmarks (default)" instead — no crash, no radio stuck on a hidden option

→ automate: jj-idea-ajd0 (settings persistence and column width/visibility persistence,
tracked in MT-LOG-TABLE, are state-serialization logic)

#### Settings — batch-2 escape hatches (jj-idea-isnf, ixju)

- [ ] **General** section: check "Disable ignored-file scanning (all repositories)" with no
      per-repo override set, click Apply. Confirm scanning stops in every repo. In a repo with
      its own override explicitly set to "off" (see Repository Settings below), confirm it still
      scans despite the global checkbox.
- [ ] **Log Settings** section: set "Context window" to 0, click Apply. Navigate to a revision
      outside the loaded log (e.g. via file annotation, or jump to a bookmark outside the
      current revset) — exactly one row (the target) appears, no ancestors/descendants. Set it
      back to 10 and repeat — the ~19-revision window returns.
- [ ] **Repository Settings** (multi-repo project): expand a repo's collapsible group. "Override
      context window" checkbox + field lets that repo use a different window (e.g. 0) than the
      project default — confirm only that repo's out-of-view navigation degenerates.
      "Override ignored-file scanning default" checkbox + "Disable ignored-file scanning for this
      repository" checkbox let a repo explicitly re-enable scanning even when the global default
      (General section) is "disabled everywhere" — confirm the override wins in both directions.

#### Settings — Support section

- [ ] Open **Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu**
- [ ] A **Support** group appears at the bottom of the panel with a "Sponsor this plugin on GitHub..." link
- [ ] Clicking the link opens `https://github.com/sponsors/kkkev` in the default browser
  (jj-idea-z1ld: `SPONSORS_URL` is now defined once in `ui/services/SponsorAsk.kt` and
  shared with the in-product sponsor ask under MT-WORKINGCOPY — both must point at the
  same URL)

#### Settings panel width (jj-idea-bwdk)

→ automate: `JujutsuConfigurablePanelTest` covers the panel's overall preferred width and a
long validation message, both without any repository configured; the checks below cover what
that test can't (a live dialog, and the per-repo group, which needs a real project).

- [ ] Open **Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu** at the dialog's default size — no horizontal
      scrollbar anywhere in the panel; the **Test** button next to the executable path is fully
      visible without scrolling
- [ ] Widen and narrow the Settings dialog — the executable path and revset fields grow/shrink
      with it; nothing gets clipped that wasn't already clipped before this change
- [ ] Click **Test** with a bogus executable path (e.g. `/bin/ls`) — the error message wraps
      over multiple lines instead of widening the panel
- [ ] **Log Settings**: the "Revset expression:" box is a ~3-line multi-line field whose left
      edge lines up with the "Changes to show:" and "Context window:" fields above it, and its
      guidance text below lines up with that same left edge (not the row's label). Type an
      expression longer than the box's width — it word-wraps inside the box instead of
      scrolling horizontally; pressing Enter does not submit or otherwise misbehave
- [ ] Enter a syntactically invalid revset (e.g. `zz(`) in **Log Settings** and click **Test** —
      the raw `jj` error wraps instead of widening the panel
- [ ] Expand **Installation Help** — every command row and its **Copy** button are fully visible
- [ ] In a multi-repo project, expand a repo under **Repository Settings** — the "Override
      revset expression" and "Override ignored-file scanning default" rows read correctly with
      their field/checkbox stacked under the label, the Test button is fully visible, and Apply
      still persists every override (identity, limit, revset, context window, ignore-scan)

#### Scoped user identity (jj-idea-i0e6, GitHub #89)

→ automate: `CliExecutorConfigTest`, `ConfigResolveTest` cover the provenance parsing;
`ScopedIdentityContractCliTest` covers the real-`jj` resolution and that the "Configure Jujutsu
User" prompt stays quiet — the check below covers what only a live Settings dialog can show (the
row's rendering and its interaction with the global fields and the override checkbox).

This needs a real scoped `~/.config/jj/config.toml` (or an equivalent `--when.repositories` config
file), which no automated test can supply — see contributing.md § Manual regression scope.

- [ ] Add a `[[--scope]]` block to your jj user config (`jj config edit --user`) with
      `--when.repositories = ["<path to a repo open in the IDE>"]` setting a `user.name`/
      `user.email` different from your normal `[user]` table
- [ ] Open **Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu**, expand that repo's **Repository Settings**
      group — an "In effect: <scoped name> \<scoped email>" line appears above "Override user
      identity", with a second, greyed line naming the config file the scope came from
- [ ] The panel's top-level **User Identity** fields still show your normal, unscoped name/email
      — not the scoped one — and Apply only ever changes that unscoped value
- [ ] Remove the scope block and reopen Settings — the row now shows your normal identity instead
      (or disappears entirely if neither is set at all)
- [ ] With **only** the scope supplying an identity (no `[user]` table, no per-repo override): no
      "Configure Jujutsu User" notification appears for that repo on IDE startup

#### Preview features (jj-idea-vpvz, jj-idea-0x06)

- [ ] Open **Settings → Version Control → Jujutsu**: a **Preview features** group appears at the
      bottom of the panel, below **Support**, with only an "Access code:" field and a one-line
      explanation — no feature
      names anywhere
- [ ] Enter an invalid code, click Apply: a "Not a valid access code." line appears; no feature
      list appears; nothing crashes
- [ ] Enter a valid legacy code, click Apply, then reopen Settings (or the panel) — no status
      line appears (nothing to add beyond what the checkboxes show), a checkbox for every preview
      feature appears underneath, and a single shared comment (noting it's unfinished and that
      reopening the IDE is needed for a toggle change to take effect) appears once below the
      whole list, not repeated per checkbox
- [ ] Enter a valid, single-feature `JJP1-...` code (needs a build whose signing key resolves —
      either `PREVIEW_CODE_KEY` set, or the local key at `~/.config/jj-idea/preview-code-key` that
      `previewCode keygen`/`mint` use by default — e.g. minted for yourself via `./gradlew
      previewCode --args="mint --features pagedLogLoad"`), click Apply, reopen Settings — no
      status line, and only that one feature's checkbox appears (no Drag and Drop checkbox)
- [ ] Mint a `JJP1` code with `--expires` set to a future month, enter it — a "Valid through ..."
      line appears above its checkbox(es)
- [ ] Mint a `JJP1` code with `--expires` set to last month, enter it — a "This code expired on
      ..." line appears instead of a feature list, and no checkboxes appear
- [ ] Clear the code and click Apply, reopen Settings — the status line and feature checkboxes
      disappear again

→ see MT-DND below for the effect of the toggle on the log table

### MT-DND

**Drag-and-drop preview gating (jj-idea-vpvz)**

**Code:** `preview/PreviewFeature.kt`, `preview/PreviewEntitlement.kt`, `preview/AccessCode.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuLogTableDnD.kt`

- [ ] With no access code entered and no `-Djjidea.preview.dragAndDrop` system property: open the
      Jujutsu log and try to drag a commit row — nothing initiates, no drag cursor, no indicator
- [ ] Enter a valid access code in Settings → Preview features, tick Drag and Drop, click Apply,
      then **restart the IDE** (or reopen the project) — dragging a commit row now initiates
- [ ] Untick Drag and Drop (or clear the code) and restart again — dragging stops initiating
- [ ] Launch with `-Djjidea.preview.dragAndDrop=true` and no access code — dragging initiates
      (the dev/CI escape hatch)

#### Drag image (mirrors the Project view's file drag)

**Code:** `ui/log/JujutsuLogTableDnD.kt` (`dragImage`)

- [ ] Dragging a commit row shows a small semi-transparent label following the cursor with the
      commit's id and description (or "N commits" for a multi-selection), the same way dragging a
      file in the Project view shows its name/icon
- [ ] The id in that label is styled the same way it is everywhere else in the log (bold unique
      prefix, grey remainder, coloured offset suffix on a divergent change) — not plain unstyled
      text
- [ ] Dragging a bookmark chip shows its name with the bookmark's own icon; dragging a tag chip
      shows its name with the tag icon
- [ ] The label stays attached to the cursor for the whole drag, not just at the start
- [ ] With the drag-scope icon group set to "Commit" (default), dragging a commit shows the label
      with no extra icon - unchanged from before jj-idea-d3u5
- [ ] Set the scope to the tree icon, then drag a commit → the label now starts with a small tree
      icon before the id (a fixed badge, not a count - see "Rebase source scope" below); set it to
      the branch icon → the label starts with a small branch icon instead
- [ ] Dragging a bookmark/tag/`@` chip is unaffected by the scope selection - no badge appears on
      those, regardless of which scope is selected

#### Commit → commit rebase by drag (jj-idea-8fxs)

The headline drag gesture: dropping a dragged commit row (or multi-selection) onto another row's
centre band runs `jj rebase --onto`; the top/bottom bands run `-A`/`-B`. Applies immediately, no
confirmation dialog, with an undo balloon on success. `RebaseSourceMode` defaults to `-r` (only the
dragged commit(s) move); see "Rebase source scope" below for `-s`/`-b`.

**Code:** `ui/dnd/DropPerformers.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuLogTableDnD.kt`, `actions/change/rebaseAction.kt`

- [ ] Drag a mutable commit onto another's **centre** band → row outline, tooltip "Rebase &lt;id&gt;
      onto &lt;id&gt;", release applies; confirm the new parent with `jj log` in a terminal
- [ ] Drag onto the **top** band → thin band outline, tooltip "...inserting after..."; confirm with
      `jj log` that it landed **visually above** the destination — the top/bottom ↔ `-A`/`-B`
      mapping is deliberately non-identity (`ui/dnd/DropTarget.kt`) and was a shipped bug once
- [ ] Drag onto the **bottom** band → lands visually below (`-B`)
- [ ] Each successful drop shows an undo balloon; clicking its Undo link reverts the graph to its
      prior shape. Dismiss a balloon on a separate drop and use the persistent Undo Last Operation
      action instead — same effect
- [ ] Drag a multi-row selection (Shift/Ctrl-click first) — all selected commits rebase together
- [ ] Drag onto an immutable commit, or onto a descendant of the dragged commit (a cycle) — a
      **filled** (not outlined) reject indicator on that row, reject cursor if it lands; drop does
      nothing. Hover slowly and confirm the filled indicator is reliably visible every time you're
      over that row - not just an occasional flicker (jj-idea-ymuu: the native reject cursor alone
      was not reliable feedback; this filled indicator is the fix, painted the same reliable way as
      the allowed-drop outline rather than depending on the cursor)
- [ ] In a multi-root project, drag a commit from one repo's row onto a row from a different repo
      in the same unified log — same filled reject indicator, same reliability check as above
- [ ] Drag a commit onto itself, or onto another member of the same multi-selection — reject
      cursor with **no** indicator at all (deliberately silent, not the same bug as above)
- [ ] Regression: the existing **Rebase...** dialog action (context menu / toolbar) also now shows
      an undo balloon on success — confirm the dialog itself is otherwise unchanged

#### Copy-modifier drag to duplicate (jj-idea-p6nb)

Same three zones as the plain rebase gesture above, but held with the platform's copy modifier —
**Option (⌥) on macOS**, matching the Project view's file drag; Ctrl on Windows/Linux. (Ctrl also
copies on macOS, but it's already bound to the secondary-click/context-menu convention there, so
prefer Option.) Runs `jj duplicate` instead of `jj rebase`; the original commit(s) stay exactly
where they were.

**Code:** `ui/dnd/DropPerformers.kt`, `actions/change/duplicateOntoAction.kt`

- [ ] Hold the copy modifier and drag a commit onto another's **centre** band → tooltip
      "Duplicate &lt;id&gt; onto &lt;id&gt;", release applies; `jj log` shows both the original,
      untouched, and a new duplicate as a child of the destination
- [ ] Same with the **top**/**bottom** bands — the duplicate lands in the insert-before/after slot,
      same non-identity top/bottom ↔ `-A`/`-B` mapping as plain rebase
- [ ] Drag a multi-row selection with the copy modifier held — all selected commits duplicate
      together, originals untouched
- [ ] Each successful duplicate shows an undo balloon; Undo removes the new commit(s) and leaves
      the originals as they were
- [ ] Duplicate a commit onto an **immutable** destination — still allowed (unlike rebase, `jj
      duplicate` never rewrites the dragged commit, so the "cannot rewrite an immutable commit"
      guard does not apply to a copy-modifier drag)
- [ ] Releasing the copy modifier mid-drag switches the tooltip/operation back to "Rebase..." for
      the same pointer position, and vice versa when it's pressed
- [ ] Regression: the existing **Duplicate Onto...** dialog action (context menu / toolbar) also
      now shows an undo balloon on success — confirm the dialog itself is otherwise unchanged

#### Drag a bookmark or tag chip onto a commit to move it (jj-idea-ibth)

**Code:** `ui/dnd/DropOperation.kt`, `ui/dnd/DropPerformers.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuLogTableDnD.kt`,
`actions/bookmark/moveBookmarkAction.kt`, `actions/tag/setTagAction.kt`

- [ ] Drag a bookmark chip from its row onto a different row's centre band → tooltip "Move
      bookmark &lt;name&gt; to &lt;id&gt;", release applies immediately with an undo balloon;
      confirm with `jj log` that the bookmark moved, and that the **selection follows the
      bookmark to its new row**
- [ ] Do the same for a tag chip → tooltip "Move tag &lt;name&gt; to &lt;id&gt;", same immediate
      apply + undo balloon
- [ ] Drag a bookmark forward onto a descendant — applies with no prompt (a plain forward move)
- [ ] Drag a bookmark **backward** (onto an ancestor, or a row not reachable forward) — a "Move
      Bookmark Backward?" confirm-and-retry prompt appears (the same one **Move Bookmark
      Here...** shows for a backward move, reused verbatim, not reimplemented); confirming
      applies the move with `-B`. Unlike the dialog's version of this prompt, the drag path
      cannot pre-classify direction, so this appears for **any** deliberate backward/sideways
      drag, not just a genuine race — the wording says so plainly and does not claim a dialog or
      a race occurred
- [ ] Move a bookmark forward, undo it (via the balloon or Undo Last Operation), then drag it
      forward again to a genuinely different descendant of its (now-reverted) position — this
      must apply cleanly with **no** backward-move prompt. If the prompt appears here, that's a
      real bug (verified via raw `jj bookmark set` that jj itself does not misclassify this
      sequence) — check with `jj log` first that the second target really is a descendant of the
      bookmark's post-undo position before filing it
- [ ] Drag a tag onto a revision where a differently-placed tag of the same name already exists —
      the existing **Set Tag Here...** dialog's "tag already exists, move it?" prompt appears here
      too; confirming applies with `--allow-move`
- [ ] Drop a bookmark/tag chip back onto the **same row** it's already on (not onto another chip
      on that row) — for a **non-conflicted** bookmark/tag, no indicator ever appears, drop is a
      silent no-op
- [ ] jj-idea-bico: for a **conflicted/divergent** bookmark or tag, each of its targets has its own
      chip on its own row (build one with the "conflicted-bm" recipe in MT-BOOKMARK's
      jj-idea-5r0g item, above). Drag either chip onto the row it's already on — unlike the
      non-conflicted case above, this **is** an operation: tooltip "Resolve bookmark &lt;name&gt;
      to &lt;id&gt;" (bookmarks) or "Move tag &lt;name&gt; to &lt;id&gt;" (tags), release applies
      with an undo balloon, and `jj bookmark list`/`jj log` afterwards shows a single,
      unconflicted target. Repeat onto the **other** chip's row after undoing — it must resolve
      there too, not silently no-op
- [ ] Drag a bookmark/tag chip near a row's **top/bottom edge band** — still resolves to that row's
      centre (no gap-based operation for a chip drag), no indicator flicker as the pointer nears
      the edge
- [ ] Drag a bookmark/tag chip across repositories in a multi-root project — filled reject
      indicator, same as a commit drag
- [ ] Drag a **commit row** onto a **tag chip** (batch 4) → tooltip "Move tag &lt;name&gt; to
      &lt;id&gt;", same immediate apply + undo balloon as dragging the tag chip itself - previously
      this fell through to a plain rebase onto that row

#### Drag a local bookmark chip onto its remote chip to push (jj-idea-vdwh)

**Code:** `ui/dnd/DropOperation.kt`, `ui/dnd/DropPerformers.kt`, `actions/bookmark/pushBookmarkAction.kt`

- [ ] With a local bookmark ahead of a tracked `name@remote`, drag the local chip onto the remote
      chip (same row or a different row) → tooltip "Push &lt;name&gt; to &lt;remote&gt;", release
      opens **Git Push** pre-filled to "Specific bookmark" with that bookmark/remote already
      selected — it never pushes without going through this dialog
- [ ] Confirm the dialog's own force-push/deletion/untracked warnings still appear as usual before
      the push runs
- [ ] With the local bookmark already in sync with its remote (nothing ahead) — dragging local onto
      `name@remote` shows no indicator; the degenerate "chips already coincide" case does nothing,
      not a crash
- [ ] Drag a **remote** chip (`name@origin`) onto the **local** chip (reverse direction) — no
      indicator, not a push
- [ ] With two remotes tracked, drag the local chip onto each remote's chip in turn — each opens
      the dialog pre-filled to that specific remote
- [ ] Cancel the pre-filled dialog — no push happens, no error

#### Files → commit squash, files → gap split (jj-idea-yvry, -b2oi)

Dragging a file selection out of a changes tree is the first drag source outside the log table
itself — the changes tree only ever *sources* a `Files` payload; the log table stays the only drop
target, same `CommitRow`/`Gap` hit-test as every other payload. Squash is dialog-gated (it merges
content and abandons the emptied source); split is dialog-gated the same way (it rewrites the
source's content).

**Code:** `ui/common/JujutsuChangesTreeDnD.kt`, `ui/dnd/DragGuards.kt` (`filesRejectionReason`),
`ui/dnd/DropPerformers.kt`, `actions/filechange/SquashIntoFilesAction.kt`
(`performFileSquashInto`), `actions/filechange/SplitFilesAction.kt` (`performFileSplit`)

- [ ] With the preview feature off, select files in the Working Copy panel's changes tree and try
      to drag them — nothing initiates, same as the log table with the feature off
- [ ] With the feature on: select one or more files in the **Working Copy** panel's changes tree,
      drag onto another mutable commit's **centre** band — tooltip names the squash, release opens
      **Squash Into** pre-filled with those files ticked and that commit as the fixed destination
      (not a free picker); confirm with `jj log`/`jj status` after accepting
- [ ] Same drag from a **commit's own changes tree** (select a historical, non-`@` commit in the
      log, drag files out of its details-panel changes tree) onto a different commit — same
      pre-filled Squash dialog
- [ ] Select files belonging to more than one commit at once in the commit-details tree (select
      multiple commits in the log first) — no drag initiates (no single owning change)
- [ ] Drag files onto their **own** owning commit's centre band — no indicator, silent no-op, no
      dialog opens
- [ ] Drag files onto an **immutable** destination — filled reject indicator, "&lt;id&gt; is
      immutable"
- [ ] With the owning commit itself immutable, drag its files anywhere — filled reject indicator,
      "Cannot rewrite an immutable commit", both for a commit-row and a gap target
- [ ] Drag files onto the owning commit's own **top or bottom** band — tooltip names the split,
      release opens **Split** pre-filled with those files ticked: **bottom** band opens in "new
      parent" mode (`jj split -B` — the ticked files become a new commit inserted as the owning
      change's parent), **top** band opens in the default "new child" mode; confirm the resulting
      commit's position with `jj log`
- [ ] Drag files into a gap on any **other** commit (not their own) — filled reject indicator
      reading "Files can only be split out next to their own change"; no dialog opens
- [ ] Cancel either pre-filled dialog — no command runs, no error
- [ ] Drag files from the Working Copy panel while a *different* repo is bound in a multi-root
      project (select files that belong to another repo, if the tree's grouping allows it) — no
      drag initiates for the other repo's files (no single owning repo)
- [ ] Confirm neither drag source disturbs the changes tree's existing behaviour: double-click to
      diff, right-click context menu, and the diff preview still work normally on the same tree

#### Bookmarks panel as drag source and drop target (jj-idea-0rdm)

The bookmarks panel becomes a second surface a bookmark/tag can be dragged from and to, in either
direction with the log table. Identity is carried directly as repo + change id, not a hydrated log
entry, so a bookmark whose change fell outside the loaded log window is still draggable/droppable -
the case this bead exists for.

**Code:** `ui/log/bookmarks/JujutsuBookmarksPanelDnD.kt`, `ui/dnd/DropTarget.kt`,
`ui/dnd/DragPayload.kt`

- [ ] Drag a local bookmark node from the panel onto a log commit row's centre band → tooltip names
      the move, release applies with an undo balloon, same as dragging the log's own chip
- [ ] Scroll or filter the log so a bookmark's change is **not currently loaded**, then drag that
      bookmark from the panel onto a commit that *is* visible → the move still works
- [ ] Drag a log commit row onto a bookmark node in the panel → same operation, reversed
- [ ] Drag a log commit row onto a **tag** node in the panel → moves the tag there
- [ ] Drag a tag node from the panel onto a log commit row → moves the tag there
- [ ] A bookmark node with no target commit (deleted, or a pending-delete row) neither drags nor
      accepts a drop - confirm with a bookmark you've just deleted but not yet refreshed away
- [ ] In a multi-root project, drag a commit from one repo's log row onto another repo's bookmark
      node in the panel (or vice versa) → filled reject indicator on the panel node, same
      reliability check as the log table's own cross-repo case (hover slowly, confirm it doesn't
      flicker away)
- [ ] Drag a bookmark/tag node onto itself, or drop it back on the row it already sits on → no
      indicator, silent no-op
- [ ] jj-idea-bico: build a conflicted bookmark with the "conflicted-bm" recipe above
      (MT-BOOKMARK's jj-idea-5r0g item), then in the panel drag its **single node** onto
      `<rev-a>`'s log row and, separately (undo in between), onto `<rev-b>`'s row — **both** must
      show the "Resolve bookmark conflicted-bm to &lt;id&gt;" tooltip and apply; neither direction
      is allowed to silently no-op the way a single-target bookmark's self-drop does above.
      Confirm with `jj bookmark list` that the conflict is actually gone afterwards
- [ ] Dragging a bookmark/tag node shows the same small cursor-following chip label the log table's
      own chip drag shows
- [ ] With the preview feature off, try dragging a node in the panel → nothing initiates

#### Push by dragging local onto remote, within the panel (jj-idea-3xab)

Complements jj-idea-vdwh for when the remote bookmark isn't visible as a log chip.

**Code:** `ui/log/bookmarks/JujutsuBookmarksPanelDnD.kt`, `ui/dnd/DropOperation.kt`,
`actions/bookmark/pushBookmarkAction.kt`

- [ ] With a local bookmark ahead of a tracked remote, drag the local node in the panel onto its
      `name@remote` node → tooltip names the push, release opens **Git Push** pre-filled to that
      bookmark/remote — it never pushes without going through the dialog
- [ ] This works even when the remote bookmark's commit isn't loaded in the log at all

#### Bookmark/tag chip drag source in the commit details panel (jj-idea-4ji7)

A bookmark or tag chip rendered in the metadata pane (bottom of the commit details panel) becomes
draggable the same way a log or panel chip is - dragging from plain description/metadata text is
unaffected.

**Code:** `ui/components/IconAwareHtmlPaneDnD.kt`, `ui/components/IconAwareHtmlPane.kt`

- [ ] Select a commit with a bookmark, drag its chip out of the details pane's metadata section
      onto another commit in the log → moves the bookmark, same as any other chip drag
- [ ] Same for a tag chip
- [ ] Click-and-drag across plain description/metadata text in the same pane (not starting on a
      chip) → normal text selection still works, unaffected
- [ ] Start a drag on a chip, release, then drag across plain text elsewhere in the pane → normal
      text selection works for that second gesture (confirms the suppression doesn't stick)
- [ ] Right-click on a chip in this pane still shows its usual ref context menu (Move/Push/Delete/
      etc.) - unaffected by the new drag source
- [ ] With the preview feature off, try dragging a chip out of the details pane → nothing initiates

#### Drag the `@` marker: edit or new-on-top by zone (jj-idea-pk2c, redesigned by jj-idea-d3u5)

The working-copy `@` marker becomes a drag source using the same zone vocabulary as the
commit-rebase gesture, not a modal dialog: drop **on** a commit's centre band to `jj edit` it
(rejected outright if immutable - no dialog); drop in the band **just above** a commit to run
`jj new` with that commit as parent, creating a new change on top of it - **always allowed**,
even for an immutable target, since `jj new` never rewrites its parent. The bottom band has no
operation for `@`.

**Code:** `ui/log/LogClickTarget.kt` (`WorkingCopyClick`), `ui/log/JujutsuLogTableRenderers.kt`
(`appendWorkingCopyMarker`), `ui/dnd/DropOperation.kt` (`EditWorkingCopy`, `NewChangeOnTop`),
`ui/dnd/DragGuards.kt` (the `WorkingCopyRef`+`CommitRow`+immutable check),
`ui/statusbar/JujutsuWorkingCopySwitcher.kt` (`editWorkingCopy`, `newChangeOnTop`)

- [ ] Drag the `@` marker (next to the current working-copy row) onto a different **mutable**
      commit's centre band → tooltip "Edit &lt;id&gt;", release runs `jj edit` immediately with an
      undo balloon; confirm with `jj log` that `@` moved
- [ ] Drag `@` onto an **immutable** commit's centre → filled reject indicator, "&lt;id&gt; is
      immutable" - no dialog appears at all, drop does nothing
- [ ] Drag `@` into the band **just above** any commit - mutable or **immutable** - → tooltip "New
      change on top of &lt;id&gt;", release creates a new child immediately with an undo balloon
      and moves `@` there; confirm with `jj log`. The immutable case is the one most worth
      checking carefully: there must be **no** reject indicator and **no** dialog here
- [ ] Drag `@` into the band **below** a commit → no indicator, not an operation
- [ ] Drag `@` onto the row it's already on (any zone) → no indicator, silent no-op (self-drop)
- [ ] In a multi-root project, drag `@` from one repo's row onto a row from a different repo → same
      filled reject indicator as a commit drag
- [ ] Dragging `@` shows a small cursor-following chip labelled "@" in the usual working-copy color
- [ ] With the preview feature off, try dragging the `@` marker → nothing initiates
- [ ] Regression: the status-bar **Switch Working Copy** popup (click path, not drag) still works
      exactly as before - it still asks its "Edit / New on Top / Cancel" dialog (a click has no
      zone to read the operation from) and still shows an undo balloon on success

#### Rebase source scope: `-r`/`-s`/`-b` (jj-idea-j8ij, redesigned by jj-idea-d3u5)

Three **mutually-exclusive icon toggle buttons** in the toolbar (only visible with the Drag and
Drop preview feature on, next to the View Options button - a commit-dot icon, a tree icon, and a
branch icon) pick whether a commit-onto-commit drag rebases just the dragged commit(s) (`-r`, the
default), the dragged commit(s) plus everything descended from them (`-s`), or the entire branch
containing them (`-b`). Exactly one is pressed/highlighted at a time - clicking a different one
presses it and un-presses the others, the same way a diff viewer's unified/side-by-side toggle
works. The setting is project-level and sticky across drags, so the drop tooltip and drag chip
both name the resolved scope every time - this is deliberate anti-footgun UX, not decoration:
confirm it rather than skipping past it. While dragging under `-s`/`-b`, the rows that would
actually move are tinted live in the log, the same green `RebasePreviewPanel`'s dialog preview
uses.

**Code:** `ui/common/CommitTablePanel.kt` (`DragScopeAction`), `settings/JujutsuSettingsState.kt`
(`dragRebaseSourceMode`), `ui/dnd/DragGuards.kt` (`DragContext.movedIds`), `ui/dnd/DropOperation.kt`
(`sourceScopeLabel`), `ui/dnd/DropPerformers.kt` (`toRebaseSpec`), `ui/log/JujutsuLogTableDnD.kt`
(`applyDragHighlight`)

- [ ] Toolbar shows three icon buttons next to View Options (commit dot / tree / branch), with the
      commit-dot one pressed/highlighted by default; hovering each shows a tooltip naming its scope
- [ ] Click the tree icon → it becomes pressed, the commit-dot icon un-presses - exactly one is
      ever pressed at a time
- [ ] With the tree icon selected, start dragging a commit that has children (don't drop yet) → its
      descendant rows tint green, live, before you release; the dragged commit's own row tints too.
      Releasing or cancelling the drag (Esc, or dropping off-target) removes the tint
- [ ] Complete that drag → tooltip read "Rebase &lt;id&gt; and its N descendant(s) onto &lt;id&gt;"
      (singular for exactly one descendant) before release; confirm with `jj log` that the children
      moved too, not just the dragged commit
- [ ] Same commit, but it's a **leaf** (no descendants) - tooltip reads exactly like the plain `-r`
      case (no "and its 0 descendants" wording), and **no** tint appears during the drag either
- [ ] Click the branch icon → it presses, the tree icon un-presses; drag a commit → tooltip reads
      "Rebase the branch containing &lt;id&gt; onto &lt;id&gt;" (no count), the whole branch tints
      live during the drag; confirm with `jj log` that the whole branch moved
- [ ] With the tree or branch icon selected, drag a **mutable** commit whose descendants/branch
      include an **immutable** commit elsewhere → filled reject indicator, "Cannot rewrite an
      immutable commit" - even though the commit under the cursor itself is mutable. This is the
      guard fix this bead shipped alongside the gesture; if it's missing, that's a real bug
- [ ] Click the commit-dot icon again and confirm the previous immutable-descendant case no longer
      rejects (only the dragged commit's own immutability matters again), and no live tint appears
      for a plain drag
- [ ] With the tree or branch icon selected, hold the **copy modifier** and drag a commit → still
      duplicates only that one commit (tooltip has no scope wording, no live tint either);
      `jj duplicate` has no `-s`/`-b` axis, so the selector is inert for a copy-modifier drag -
      confirm with `jj log` that descendants were *not* duplicated
- [ ] Change the selection, close and reopen the project (or restart the IDE) → the choice persisted
- [ ] With the Drag and Drop preview feature off, all three icon buttons are entirely absent

### MT-CROSS

**Multi-repository, visual consistency, edge cases, and error handling**

**Code:** `ui/log/JujutsuRootFilterComponent.kt`, `ui/log/RootFilterSelection.kt`, `ui/log/JujutsuRootGutterRenderer.kt`, `ui/log/RepositoryColors.kt`, `ui/common/JjNotInstalledPanel.kt`

#### Multi-Repository (if applicable)

- [ ] Root filter appears for multi-root projects and hides for single-root projects
- [ ] Root gutter column shows repo names
- [ ] Tri-state root filter (jj-idea-qcks, GitHub #96): open the Root filter popup — a
      "Select All" header, then one outlined coloured square per root. Click a root once:
      icon fills, popup stays open, log shows only that root. Click again: icon shows an
      outlined-and-struck-through square, log shows every root *except* it. Click again:
      back to outline, log shows everything
- [ ] Include one root and exclude another — only the included root shows (included wins).
      Cycle the included root back to unset — the excluded root stays hidden, everything
      else shows
- [ ] With a root excluded, click "Select All": every root fills and the exclusion clears;
      click "Select None": all icons return to outline and every row shows
- [ ] Restart the IDE — the include/exclude selection persists. Then remove the
      `excludedRootPaths` element from `.idea/jujutsu.xml` by hand and restart — loads
      cleanly with no exclusions (old settings files without the field)
- [ ] With an include active, map an additional repo (**Settings → Version Control**) — it
      stays hidden. Clear the filter, exclude one root instead, map another repo — it shows
- [ ] Entries from different roots sort by timestamp
- [ ] Reference filter and graph repo scoping: see MT-LOG-FILTER's "Multi-repo scoping" subsection
      (jj-idea-1ra9) — no cross-repo ancestry or graph lines, even when repos' root commits share
      a change id

#### Visual Consistency

- [ ] Light and dark themes both render correctly: icons at correct size, row striping,
      hover highlighting, distinct selected-row highlighting, disabled actions grayed out

#### Edge Cases

- [ ] Empty repository shows an appropriate message; large repository (100+ commits) loads
      without hanging; rapid filtering doesn't cause errors
- [ ] Very long descriptions truncate with ellipsis; non-ASCII characters display correctly

#### Error Handling

- [ ] Invalid JJ path, non-JJ repository, network errors, and concurrent operations each
      show a helpful/user-friendly message rather than corrupting state or crashing
- [ ] Backend without `remote_bookmarks()` revset support (jj-idea-2wpq, GitHub #35; can't be
  reproduced with stock jj — requires a non-standard backend, e.g. Google-internal
  Piper/p4base-backed jj) loads the log and working copy successfully, minus the
  pushed-ancestor decoration (the "Open File in remote" action stays hidden) — instead of
  failing the whole load. A one-time WARN is logged on first detection; subsequent
  refreshes/loads for that repo don't re-probe or repeat the warning for the rest of the
  session
